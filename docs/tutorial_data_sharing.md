# Tutorial: Data Sharing with WEBKNOSSOS

In this tutorial, you will discover how to efficiently manage and share your data in WEBKNOSSOS. You will learn how to effortlessly upload your data, securely store it, and easily share it with your collaborators using a simple link. I will also guide you through the process of granting access permissions to designated collaborator teams, and show you how to work collaboratively on annotations. Finally, I will explain how you can make your data publicly available and share it with the wider world. Let’s dive in and unlock the power of data collaboration!

## Dataset Upload

To add a dataset, go to the “Dataset” tab and click on “Add Dataset”. Give your dataset a name, choose which teams will have access to it, and a target folder to organize the dataset into a collection.

## Data Sharing

Copy the link to your dataset, and share it with your colleagues via your preferred application for them to easily access and open it (e.g., email, Slack, MS Teams, etc.).

## Dataset Organization, Teams, And Access Permissions

To organize your project, create a new folder and add the corresponding datasets. Folders can help with organizing and structuring datasets as you grow, as well as control access rights to the datasets.

## Collaborate On Annotations

To share an annotation with collaborators, click “Share” from the dropdown menu. Choose one or several teams for which this annotation should be listed and adjust the settings to allow editing.

All users assigned to these teams now have access to this annotation right from their dashboard. They can now edit and expand on your work.

## Make A Dataset Publicly Available

To share your dataset publicly, i.e. without requiring a WEBKNOSSOS account or login, navigate to the settings and adjust the visibility to ‘public’. Once done, copy the dataset link and include it in your publication or freely share it with others.
