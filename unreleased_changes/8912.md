### Added
- Datasets can be uploaded to S3-compatible object storage services. This is disabled by default.

### Migration
- New keys have been added to the application.conf of the datastore.

Add these lines in the "datastore" section to enable S3 upload:
```
s3Upload {
  enabled = false
  # Use the name of a credential in the dataVaults section here to use it for uploads.
  credentialName = "s3://example/uri/prefix"
  objectKeyPrefix = "webknossos-uploads"
}
```
