## Unreleased

[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/22.06.1...HEAD)

### Added
- Added a image data download speed indicator to the statusbar. On hover a tooltip is shown that show the total amount of downloaded shard data. [#6269](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6269)
- Added a warning for when the resolution in the XY viewport on z=1-downsampled datasets becomes too low, explaining the problem and how to mitigate it. [#6255](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6255)
- Provide a UI to download/export a dataset in view-mode. The UI explains how to access the data with the python library. [#6283](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6283)
- Added the possibility to view and download older versions of read-only annotations. [#6274](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6274)

### Changed

- For the api routes that return annotation info objects, the user field was renamed to owner. User still exists as an alias, but will be removed in a future release. [#6250](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6250)
- Slimmed the URLs for annotations by removing `Explorational` and `Task`. The old URLs are still supported, but will be redirected to the new format. [#6208](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6208)
- When creating a task from a base annotation, the starting position/rotation and bounding box as specified during task creation are now used and overwrite the ones from the original base annotation. [#6249](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6249)

### Fixed
- Fixed that bounding boxes were deletable in read-only tracings although the delete button was disabled. [#6273](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6273)
- Fixed that (old) sharing links with tokens did not work, because the token was removed during a redirection. [#6281](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6281)
