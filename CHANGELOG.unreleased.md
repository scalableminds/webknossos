## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/24.06.0...HEAD)

### Added
- Added that proofreading merge actions reuse custom names of segments. A merge action now combines the potenial existing custom names of both segments and a split-action copies the custom name to the split-off segment. [#7877](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7877)
- Added the option for the owner to lock explorative annotations. Locked annotations cannot be modified by any user. An annotation can be locked in the annotations table and when viewing the annotation via the navbar dropdown menu. [#7801](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7801)
- Added the option to set a default mapping for a dataset in the dataset view configuration. The default mapping is loaded when the dataset is opened and the user / url does not configure something else. [#7858](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7858)
- Uploading an annotation into a dataset that it was not created for now also works if the dataset is in a different organization. [#7816](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7816)
- When downloading + reuploading an annotation that is based on a segmentation layer with active mapping, that mapping is now still be selected after the reupload. [#7822](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7822)
- In the Voxelytics workflow list, the name of the WEBKNOSSOS user who started the job is displayed. [#7794](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7795)
- Start an alignment job (aligns the section in a dataset) via the "AI Analysis" button. [#7820](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7820)
- Added additional validation for the animation job modal. Bounding boxes must be larger then zero. [#7883](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7883)

### Changed
- The "WEBKNOSSOS Changelog" modal now lazily loads its content potentially speeding up the initial loading time of WEBKNOSSOS and thus improving the UX. [#7843](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7843)
- Updated the min max settings for the histogram to allow floating point color layers to have negative min / max values. [#7873](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7873)
- Made the login, registration, forgot password and dataset dashboard pages more mobile friendly. [#7876](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7876)
- From now on only project owner get a notification email upon project overtime. The organization specific email list `overTimeMailingList` was removed. [#7842](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7842)
- Replaced skeleton comment tab component with antd's `<Tree />`component. [#7802](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7802)
- Updated Typescript to version 5.5.0. [#7878](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7878)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where the warning to zoom in to see the agglomerate mapping was shown to the user even when the 3D viewport was maximized and no volume data was shown. [#7865](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/issues/7865) 
- Fixed a bug that prevented saving new dataset settings. [#7903](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7903)
- Fixed a bug where brushing on a fallback segmentation with active mapping and with segment index file would lead to failed saves. [#7833](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7833)
- Fixed a bug where the "Hide Meshes" / "Show Meshes" options of the context menu for segment groups were not available although at leas one mesh was set to visible / invisible. [#7890](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7890)
- Fixed a bug where sometimes old mismatching javascript code would be served after upgrades. [#7854](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7854)
- Fixed a bug where dataset uploads of zipped tiff data via the UI would be rejected. [#7856](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7856)
- Fixed a bug with incorrect validation of layer names in the animation modal. [#7882](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7882)
- Fixed a bug in the fullMesh.stl route used by the render_animation worker job, where some meshes in proofreading annotations could not be loaded. [#7887](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7887)
- Fixed that dataset composition did not work when selecting only one dataset for composition. [#7889](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7889)

### Removed
- If the datasource-properties.json file for a dataset is missing or contains errors, WEBKNOSSOS no longer attempts to guess its contents from the raw data. Exploring remote datasets will still create the file. [#7697](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7697)
