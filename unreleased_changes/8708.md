### Changed
- A new directory is no longer created for new remote or composed datasets.

### Breaking Changes
- Datasets are now referenced by their ID instead of the combination of the organization and the directory name. 
- Newly uploaded datasets do not use the `wkwResolutions` property anymore, but instead use `mags` like imported remote datasets.
- Interacting with newly created datasets requires libraries to support API version of 10 or higher.
