# Collaboration & Sharing

WEBKNOSSOS is built for working collaboratively and sharing your work with colleagues, collaborators, and the scientific community.
Anything in WEBKNOSSOS can be shared: the raw datasets, any skeleton or volume annotations, or complex segmentations.

When speaking about collaboration and sharing, we imagine three scenarios supported by WEBKNOSSOS:

1. Sharing data with outsiders - anyone who is not a member of your WEBKNOSSOS organization, e.g., colleagues from other institutes, reviewers, publishers, a paper publication, and the research community as a whole (read-only).
2. Sharing data within your organization to collaborate with other members/co-workers (both read-only or modifiable)
3. Reconstruction of large datasets through a divide-and-conquer strategy with the [projects and tasks system](../tasks_projects/index.md).

Since WEBKNOSSOS is a web platform, most resources can be shared as a web link/URL. This makes it super easy to integrate WEBKNOSSOS in your existing communication workflows, e.g.:

- send collaborators an _email_ containing a link to specific, interesting data locations or annotations
- include a link in a _publication_ so readers can have direct access to the data to see for themselves
- share a link through _Slack_, _MS Teams_, or any other messenger service
- include it in any _lab journal_ and _blog_ posts
- link it in a _forum_ post

In many ways, sharing by web link works similarly to products like Google Drive or Dropbox.

WEBKNOSSOS sharing is tightly integrated with user permissions and access rights. See the sections [on dataset management](../datasets/index.md) and [user administration](../users/index.md) for more info.
