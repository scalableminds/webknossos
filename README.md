WEBKNOSSOS is an open-source tool for annotating and exploring large 3D image datasets.

* Fly through your data for fast skeletonization and proof-reading
* Create 3D training data for automated segmentations efficiently
* Scale data reconstruction projects with crowdsourcing workflows
* Share datasets and annotations with collaborating scientists
