# Using External Datastores

The system architecture of WEBKNOSSOS allows for versatile deployment options where you can install a dedicated datastore server directly on your lab's cluster infrastructure.
This may be useful when dealing with large datasets that should remain in your data center.
[Please contact us](mailto:hello@webknossos.org) or [write a post](https://forum.image.sc/tag/webknossos), if you require any assistance with your setup.

scalable minds also offers a dataset alignment tool called *Voxelytics Align*.
