### Added
- Added a function to the frontend, that allows to react to specific actions for better script customizability.

### Fixed
- Fixed multiple mesh related frontend API function (setMeshVisibility, removeMesh, and resetMeshes). Moreover, the mesh visibility is now applied even when changed during loading the mesh.
