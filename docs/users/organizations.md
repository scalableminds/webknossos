# Organizations

The root entity in WEBKNOSSOS is an *organization*.
You will create one when setting up WEBKNOSSOS or when signing up for an account on [webknossos.org](https://webknossos.org).
An organization contains all your users, datasets, annotations, and other data.
Organizations are isolated from each other.
You are not allowed to see data from organizations other than your own. 
Members from other organizations will not be able to see data from your organization.

You can invite other users to join your organization and collaborate on datasets. Datasets and annotations are shared between members of an organization. You can finetune access rights to datasets and visibility on the dashboard on various levels.

## Switching Organizations
A WEBKNOSSOS user account can be part of more than one organization, .e.g., when your are invited to collaborate on projects of another institute, working as a different WEBKNOSSOS organization.

If you are part of multiple organizations, you can switch between them from the "User avatar" menu. 
Click on your user avatar in the top-right corner of the screen and select an entry from the "Switch Organization" menu.
WEBKNOSSOS will quickly reload and switch your account to that organization, i.e. refresh your dashboard, access permissions, annotations, etc. to match your account in the selected organization.
