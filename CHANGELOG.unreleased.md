### Changed
- Improved the UI in navigation bar during loading of tracings and datasets. [#4612](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4612)
- Improved logging in case of very slow annotation saving. Additionally, the user is also warned when there are unsaved changes older than two minutes. [#4593](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4593)
