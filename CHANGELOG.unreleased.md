## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/21.09.0...HEAD)

### Added
- Enhanced the volume fill tool to so that it operates beyond the dimensions of the current viewport. Additionally, the fill tool can also be changed to perform in 3D instead of 2D. [#5733](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5733)
- Added the possibility to load the skeletons of specific agglomerates from an agglomerate file when opening a tracing by including a mapping and agglomerate ids in the URL hash. See the [docs](https://docs.webknossos.org/webknossos/sharing.html#sharing-link-format) for further information. [#5738](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5738)
- Added a skeleton sandbox mode where a dataset can be opened and all skeleton tracing capabilities are available. However, by default changes are not saved. At any point, users can decide to copy the current state to their account. The sandbox can be accessed at `<webknossos_host>/datasets/<organization>/<dataset>/sandbox/skeleton`. In the combination with the new agglomerate skeleton loading feature this can be used to craft links that open webknossos with an activated mapping and specific agglomerates loaded on-demand. [#5738](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5738)
- The active mapping is now included in the link copied from the "Share" modal or the new "Share" button next to the dataset position. It is automatically activated for users that open the shared link. [#5738](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5738)
- A new "Segments" tab was added which replaces the old "Meshes" tab. The tab renders a list of segments within a volume annotation for the visible segmentation layer. The list "grows" while creating an annotation or browsing a dataset. For example, selecting an existing segment or drawing with a new segment id will both ensure that the segment is listed. Via right-click, meshes can be loaded for a selected segment. The mesh will be added as child to the segment. [#5696](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5696)
- For ad-hoc mesh computation and for mesh precomputation, the user can now select which quality the mesh should have (i.e., via selecting which magnification should be used). [#5696](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5696)
- The context menu in the data viewport also allows to compute an ad-hoc mesh for the selected segment. [#5696](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5696)

### Changed
- Improved the movement behavior when using shortcuts to navigate along the 3rd dimension. Instead of clamping the sub-voxel position to .0 or .99 on the initial movement, the keyboard delay is adapted dynamically to avoid too fast movements. This change especially improves the move behavior when quickly changing the direction backwards/forwards. [#5801](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5801)

### Fixed
- Fixed two volume tracing related bugs which could occur when using undo with a slow internet connection or when volume-annotating more than 5000 buckets (32**3 vx) in one session. [#5728](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5728)
- Jobs status is no longer polled if jobs are not enabled, avoiding backend logging spam [#5761](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5761)
- Fixed a bug that windows user could not open the context menu as it instantly closed after opening. [#5756](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5756).
- Fixed a bug where the health check of public datasets failed if no cookie/token was supplied. [#5768](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5768).
- Fixed a bug where retried save requests could lead to a 409 CONFLICT error if the first request was already handled by the back-end. [#5779](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5779).
- Fixed a bug where volume annotations could not be saved under certain circumstances (if "Render Missing Data Black" was disabled and a data bucket was annotated for the first time). [#5783](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5783)
- Fixed a bug which made the ad-hoc mesh loading abort too early. [#5696](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5696)
- Fixed that viewports turned black when zoomed in very much. [#5797](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5797)
- Fixed the bucket loading order in the YZ and XZ viewports. Data in these viewports will be rendered faster than before. [#5798](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5798)
- Fixed that collapsing/expanding the sidebars did not work for touchscreens. [#5825](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5825)
- Fixed a bug where projects could not be listed if the tracing time got too large. [#5823](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5823)
