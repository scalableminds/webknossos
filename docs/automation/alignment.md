# Alignment

For single-tile image stacks, an alignment is directly possible from within WEBKNOSSOS.
Simply upload the dataset, open it and select the "Alignment" tab in the AI Analysis dialog.

You can even annotate landmarks with the skeleton tool and use that to let WEBKNOSSOS align the dataset. Often these landmarks are not necessary, but for particularly hard to align sections, they can be quite useful. When manual landmarks are used, they don't need to cover the entire dataset.

For multi-tile image stacks, please refer to our [Alignment services](https://webknossos.org/services/alignment).
