## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/23.11.0...HEAD)
- The config `setting play.http.secret.key` (secret random string) now requires a minimum length of 32 bytes.
- If your setup contains webknossos-workers, postgres evolution 110 introduces the column `supportedJobCommands`. This needs to be filled in manually for your workers. Currently available job commands are `compute_mesh_file`, `compute_segment_index_file`, `convert_to_wkw`, `export_tiff`, `find_largest_segment_id`, `infer_nuclei`, `infer_neurons`, `materialize_volume_annotation`, `render_animation`. [#7463](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7463)
- If your setup contains webknossos-workers,  postgres evolution 110 introduces the columns `maxParallelHighPriorityJobs` and `maxParallelLowPriorityJobs`. Make sure to set those values to match what you want for your deployment. [#7463](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7463)
- If your setup contains webknossos-workers, you may want to add the new available worker job `compute_segment_index_file` to the `supportedJobCommands` column of one or more of your workers. [#7493](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7493)
