## Import Volume Annotations

To import a volume annotation, ensure it is in the correct format (WKW or Zarr) and compressed in a zip folder. Next, navigate to your annotation dashboard and simply drag and drop the zip folder into the WEBKNOSSOS interface. The annotation will automatically open, allowing you to edit it as usual. It will also be added to your annotation list for future access.

## Export Volume Annotations
To export (download) an annotation, go to **Menu > Download**. From there, select the data you want to download and choose the desired format (WKW, Zarr). Alternatively, you can open your annotation dashboard and click **Download** next to the annotation.
