### Changed
- When creating an annotation from the dataset view mode, and more than one segmentation layer is visible or multiple segmentation layers are invisible but available, a selection modal now appears allowing users to choose which segmentation layer to use for the newly created volume annotation. Per default, annotations are still based on the visible segmentation layer.
