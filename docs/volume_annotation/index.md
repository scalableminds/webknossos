# Volume Annotations

WEBKNOSSOS supports volume/segmentation annotations. This annotation type lets you label voxel groups using efficient drawing tools. In the following pages, you will learn: 

- Which [volume annotation tools](../volume_annotation/tools.md) are available and how to use them
- What the [segment list](../volume_annotation/segments_list.md) is
- How to get [statistics](segments_statistics.md) on your segments
- How to [import and export](import_export.md) volume annotations
- How to use [pen tablets and iPads](pen_tablets.md) to annotate on WEBKNOSSOS
