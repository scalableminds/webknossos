### Added
- Datasets can be uploaded to S3-compatible object storage services. This is disabled by default.

### Migration
- New keys have been added to the application.conf of the data store.

Add these lines in the "datastore" section:
```
s3Upload {
    enabled = true
    # Use the prefix / name of a credential in the dataVaults section here to use it for uploads.
    credentialName = "s3://fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/webknossos-test/upload-tests/"
    endpoint = "https://fsn1.your-objectstorage.com"
    bucketName = "webknossos-test"
    objectKeyPrefix = "upload-tests"
  }
```
