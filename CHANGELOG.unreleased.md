## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/23.01.0...HEAD)

### Added
- The target folder of a dataset can now be specified during upload. Also, clicking "Add Dataset" from an active folder will upload the dataset to that folder by default. [#6704](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6704)
- The storage used by an organizationâ€™s datasets can now be measured. [#6685](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6685)
- Precomputed meshes can now be loaded even when a mapping is active (HDF5 or an editable mapping produced by the proofreading tool). The precomputed mesh has to be computed without a mapping for this to work. [#6569](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6569)
