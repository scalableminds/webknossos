# Status Bar

The status bar at the bottom of the screen serves three functions:

1. It shows context-sensitive mouse and keyboard control hints. Depending on your selected annotation tool amd any pressed modifier keys (Shift, CMD, CTRL, ALT, etc) it provides useful interaction hints and shortcuts.
2. It provides useful information based on your mouse positioning and which objects it hovers over. This includes the current mouse position in the dataset coordinate space, any segment ID that you hover over, and the currently rendered magnification level (MipMap image pyramid) used for displaying any data.
3. When working with skeletons, the active node and tree IDs are listed. Use the little pencil icon to select/mark a specific ID as active if required. For more on the active node ID, [see the section on skeleton annotations](../skeleton_annotation/index.md).
