# Welcome to webKnossos

TODO: Friendly intro

Cellular-resolution connectomics is currently substantially limited by the throughput and efficiency of data analysis. 
Current solutions require an efficient integration of automated image analysis with massive manual data annotation. 
To scale such annotation efforts it is decisive to be able to crowd source data analysis online. 
Here we present **webKnossos**.
