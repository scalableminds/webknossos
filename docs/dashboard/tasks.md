# Tasks Dashboard

With Tasks, you can coordinate large annotation projects with your users.
Tasks are small annotation work assignments that are automatically distributed to users. This is particularly useful when you have several users in your organization that you can distribute the work to, e.g., working students, scientific assistances, outside collaborators, etc.

On the Task screen, users can request new tasks, continue to work on existing tasks, and finish tasks. These tasks are assigned based on a user's experience level, project priority, and task availability.
Read more about the tasks feature in the [Tasks and Projects guide](../tasks_projects/index.md).
