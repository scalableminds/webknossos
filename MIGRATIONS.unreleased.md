## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/23.10.2...HEAD)

- The `datastore/isosurface` configuration key was renamed to `datastore/adHocMesh.
- In order to enable segment statistics for existing volume annotations (without fallback segmentation), a user with superuser rights can call a migration route during a downtime. This will transform all volume annotation layers that qualify (cross organization). This will take some time, results will be logged by WEBKNOSSOS to stdout. The trigger route is `curl -X PATCH "<domain>/api/annotations/addSegmentIndicesToAll?parallelBatchCount=16" -H 'X-Auth-Token: <token>'` with the `parallelBatchCount` parameter controlling the parallelity of the migration (e.g. number of cpu cores of the tracingstore server). This action is designed to be idempotent.
