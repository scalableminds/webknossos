## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/24.11.1...HEAD)

### Added
- When exploring remote URIs pasted from Neuroglancer, the format prefixes like `precomputed://` are now ignored, so users donâ€™t have to remove them. [#8195](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8195)

### Changed
- Reading image files on datastore filesystem is now done asynchronously. [#8126](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8126)
- Datasets can now be renamed and can have duplicate names. [#8075](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8075)
- Improved error messages for starting jobs on datasets from other organizations. [#8181](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8181)
- Terms of Service for Webknossos are now accepted at registration, not afterward. [#8193](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8193)

### Fixed
- Fix performance bottleneck when deleting a lot of trees at once. [#8176](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8176)

- Fix a bug where changing the color of a segment via the menu in the segments tab would update the segment color of the previous segment, on which the context menu was opened. [#8225](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8225)
- Fix a bug where in the add remote dataset view the dataset name setting was not in sync with the datasource setting of the advanced tab making the form not submittable. [#8245](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8245)
- Fix a bug when importing an NML with groups when only groups but no trees exist in an annotation. [#8176](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8176)
- Added missing legacy support for `isValidNewName` route. [#8252](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8252)
- Fix a bug where trying to delete a non-existing node (via the API, for example) would delete the whole active tree. [#8176](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8176)
- Fix a bug where dataset uploads would fail if the organization directory on disk is missing. [#8230](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8230)
