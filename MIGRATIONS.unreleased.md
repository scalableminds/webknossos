## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/23.11.0...HEAD)

- If your deployment starts FossilDB separately, make sure to upgrade to version 0.1.27 (build master__484). Note that with the upgraded version, the database contents are automatically migrated. A downgrade to an older FossilDB version is not possible afterwards (creating an additional backup of the FossilDB data directory is advised)
- WEBKNOSSOS now sets the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) HTTP response header restricting which dynamic resources are allowed to load. Please update the `application.conf` - `play.filters.headers.contentSecurityPolicy` key if you'd like to change the default CSP. The default CSP is suited for WEBKNOSSOS development, replace it with the commented out production version when deploying WEBKNOSSOS. [#7367](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7367)
