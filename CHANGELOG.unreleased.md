## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/20.10.0...HEAD)

### Added
- Hybrid tracings can now be imported directly in the tracing view via drag'n'drop. [#4837](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4837)
- The find data function now works for volume tracings, too. [#4847](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4847)
- Added admins and dataset managers to dataset access list, as they can access all datasets of the organization. [#4862](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4862)
- Sped up the NML parsing via dashboard import. [#4872](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4872)
- Movements in the 3D viewport are now time-tracked. [#4876](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4876)

### Changed
- Brush circles are now connected with rectangles to provide a continuous stroke even if the brush is moved quickly. [#4785](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4822)
