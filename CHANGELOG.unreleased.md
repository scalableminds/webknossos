## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/20.07.0...HEAD)

### Added

- Added a warning to the segmentation tab when viewing `uint64` bit segmentation data. [#4598](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4598)
- Added the possibility to have multiple user-defined bounding boxes in an annotation. Task bounding boxes are automatically converted to such user bounding boxes upon “copy to my account” / reupload as explorational annotation. [#4536](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4536)
- Added additional information to each task in CSV download. [#4647](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4647)

### Changed
- Separated the permissions of Team Managers (now actually team-scoped) and Dataset Managers (who can see all datasets). The database evolution makes all Team Managers also Dataset Managers, so no workflows should be interrupted. New users may have to be made Dataset Managers, though. For more information, refer to the updated documentation. [#4663](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4663)
- Refined all webKnossos emails for user signups etc. Switched emails to use HTML templates for more bling bling [#4676](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4676)

### Fixed
- Fixed that merger mode didn't work with undo and redo. Also fixed that the mapping was not disabled when disabling merger mode. [#4669](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4669)
- Fixed a bug where webKnossos relied upon but did not enforce organization names to be unique. [#4685](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4685)
- Fixed that being outside of a bounding box could be rendered as if one was inside the bounding box in some cases. [#4690](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4690)

### Removed
