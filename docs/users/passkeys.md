# Passkeys

Passkeys are a new, more secure way to log in to websites and apps without using a password.
Instead of typing a password, you use a fingerprint, face scan, or a device PIN to authenticate.

## Adding and Removing Passkeys

Users can _add_ and _remove_ their passkeys as long as they are logged in.
Passkeys can be found by clicking on the user's avatar in the navigation bar in the top-right corner of the screen and selecting `Change Password`.
Users find their passkeys below the change password form.
To add a new passkey user can press the `Register Passkey` button and then set a name for the passkey.
These passkeys can be deleted by pressing the `Delete` button next to the passkey's name.

In case the user lost access to its passkey and can not sign in.
Please use the `Forgot Password` button in the log in screen (see [Password and Account](./password.md)).
