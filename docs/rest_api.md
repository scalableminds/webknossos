# WEBKNOSSOS REST API

The following HTTP requests may be used to interact with the backend of WEBKNOSSOS. Please keep the server load in mind and avoid sending excessive amounts of requests or huge individual ones.

## Authentication

All API routes expect the HTTP header `X-Auth-Token` to be set to your personal WEBKNOSSOS token. You can find this token in the WEBKNOSSOS menu, directly above “logout”.

## Versioning

The API is subject to frequent changes. However, older versions will be supported for some time via prefixed routes.
 - To access the latest version, call the routes below with only the `/api` prefix.
 - To access a specific version, call the routes below with a prefix in the form of `/api/v1`.

New versions will be documented here, detailing the changes. Note, however, that some changes are not considered to be breaking the API and will not lead to new versions. Such changes include new optional parameters as well as new fields in the responses. The same goes for error message wording.

### Current api version is `v5`

* Changed in all versions: `GET /datasets` no longer respects the isEditable parameter.

* New in v5:
  - The annotation json no longer contains `skeletonTracingId` and `volumeTracingId`, but instead a list of `annotationLayers`, each containing `tracingId: String, typ: AnnotationLayerType, name: Option[String]`.
  - `createExplorational` now expects a list of layer parameters (`typ: AnnotationLayerType, fallbackLayerName: Option[String], resolutionRestrictions: Option[ResolutionRestrictions], name: Option[String]`)

* New in v4: /projects routes no longer expect `name` but now `id`. The same goes for `POST /tasks/list` when filtering by project.

* New in v3: the info and finish requests of annotations now expect an additional `timestamp` GET parameter that should be set to the time the request is sent (e.g. Date.now()).

* New in v2: in comparison to `v1` the annotation `isPublic` flag was replaced by a `visibility` field. This field can have the following values: `Public, Internal, Private`.

#### Note

The compound annotations are created as merged from the finished annotations associated with the Task/Project/TaskType. This merging is performed before this info request is answered and can be slow for large numbers of annotations. The merged annotations are then stored in a cache for a few minutes, but not on disk. If requested again within this time, the request will be answered more quickly, but newly finished annotations will not be included yet. This cache is shared between this info request and the download request.

   - In case of compound downloads (CompoundTask/CompoundProject/CompoundTaskType):
     - A ZIP file containing individual NML files for all associated annotations


#### Note
 - The volume data zip file name used to always be `data.zip`, when wk supported only a single volume layer per annotation. Please use the file names referenced in the `<volume>` tags in the NML file instead.
