  <li><a href="https://docs.webknossos.org/webknossos-py/index.html">Try our Python library for uploading datasets</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.webknossos.org/webknossos/datasets.html#working-with-zarr-neuroglancer-precomputed-and-n5-datasets">Try streaming your data as Zarr, Neuroglancer, or N5 files instead of uploading</a></li>
