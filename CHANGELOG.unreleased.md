### Added
- Added sign in via OIDC. [#6534](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6534)

- Added the option to search a specific folder in the new datasets tab. [#6677](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6677)
- The new datasets tab in the dashboard allows multi-selection of datasets so that multiple datasets can be moved to a folder at once. As in typical file explorers, CTRL + left click adds individual datasets to the current selection. Shift + left click selects a range of datasets.
