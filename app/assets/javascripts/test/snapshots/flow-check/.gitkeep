This folder is used to write backend objects that are retrieved during end-to-end testing to disk.
The backend objects are written as part of a syntactically correct javascript file and include their respective flow type.
After running the end-to-end tests, flow will be run to check whether the frontend flow types are in concordance with the objects retrieved from the backend.
