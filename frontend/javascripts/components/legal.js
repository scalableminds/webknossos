            <p>
              webKnossos is a team-based open-source tool for exploring and collaboratively
              annotating 3D image datasets. Viewing datasets is possible without a registration.
              However, if users want to create annotations or perform any other changes to the
              system, they need to have a registered account. Personal data is processed in
              webKnossos. This privacy statement describes the data that is processed, the rights
              data subjects have, what external services are used and other privacy-related
              information.
            </p>

              <li>
                An &quot;<strong>instance</strong>&quot; of webKnossos is one installation of the
                application on a server with one domain name attached (e.g. https://webknossos.org).
              </li>
              <li>
                Persons that use webKnossos are &quot;<strong>users</strong>&quot; or &quot;
                <strong>you</strong>&quot; (in GDPR terms &quot;<strong>data subjects</strong>
                &quot;).
              </li>
              <li>
                &quot;<strong>Anonymous users</strong>&quot; are users that do not have a registered
                account with webKnossos.
              </li>
              <li>
                &quot;<strong>Registered users</strong>&quot; have an account. webKnossos processes
                personal data of users.
              </li>
              <li>
                An instance that the user uses is referred to as the &quot;<strong>service</strong>
                &quot;.
              </li>
              <li>
                The &quot;<strong>controller</strong>&quot; is the person or legal entity that is
                responsible for the processing of personal data within the meaning of GDPR (see GDPR
                Art. 4 (7) for full definition).
              </li>
              <li>
                A research group or research lab or other entity that uses webKnossos for their team
                is technically represented as an &quot;<strong>organization</strong>&quot; in
                webKnossos. The organization or their representative is the data controller of the
                information within their instance of webKnossos.
              </li>
              <li>
                When multiple organizations share a webKnossos instance, they are joint controllers
                for shared information (e.g. data of anonymous users) and single controllers for
                organization-specific information (e.g. data of registered users).
              </li>
              <li>
                webKnossos may be provided as a hosted service. In that case, the hosting provider
                is a &quot;<strong>processor</strong>&quot; within the meaning of GDPR (see GDPR
                Art. 4 (8) for full definition). The processor performs data processing on behalf of
                the controller.

                In order to provide the webKnossos application, several external services are used.
                Some personal data of users may be transmitted to these services as described below.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function) is a web analytics service. Web
                    analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior
                    of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about
                    which features were used, or how often and for what duration a feature has been
                    used. Web analytics are used for the optimization and maintenance of a website.
                    The legal basis for using Google Analytics is a legitimate interest to provide
                    and improve the service. Read more below.

                  <li>
                    Airbrake is an error reporting tool. System errors that occur in the application
                    are logged in Airbrake. When an error occurs the IP address of the user, as well
                    as the user account information of registered users, are transmitted to
                    Airbrake. The purpose of error reporting is to resolve errors and therefore to
                    ensure uninterrupted service. Airbrake is operated by Airbrake Technologies,
                    Inc., 535 Mission Street, 14th floor, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA. After 30
                    days data is automatically deleted from the service. The legal basis for using
                    Airbrake is a legitimate interest to provide and improve the service.

                  <li>
                    Request logs are collected that contain a series of general data and information
                    when a data subject or automated systems calls up webKnossos. This general data
                    and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the
                    browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing
                    system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website
                    (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to
                    the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the
                    Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar
                    data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information
                    technology systems. This data is used for resolving errors and therefore to
                    ensure uninterrupted service. Logs are automatically deleted after 30 days. The
                    legal basis for collecting logs is a legitimate interest to provide and improve
                    the service.

            <h3>Legal basis</h3>
            <p>
              Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we
              obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data
              is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party,
              as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply
              of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit.
              b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for
              carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning
              our products or services. Are we subject to a legal obligation by which processing of
              personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the
              processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>
              In case of a hosted webKnossos service, the processing is performed by the processor
              on behalf of the controller.
            </p>
            <h3>Data security</h3>
            <p>
              The processor has implemented a number of technological and organizational measures in
              order to maintain the safety and integrity of your data.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Servers are actively maintained and updated with state-of-the-art technologies and
                security patches to prevent malware and attackers.
              </li>
              <li>Unusual resource consumption is regularly monitored. </li>
              <li>
                Access control to the servers is implemented with encrypted challenge-response
                methods.
              </li>
              <li>Employees are granted access to the servers only if they need it. </li>
              <li>Regular and encrypted backups are implemented and monitored. </li>
              <li>
                Employees are required to attend regular privacy training in order to ensure
                responsible handling of personal data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Suppliers and integrated services are evaluated and inspected on a regular basis.

            <h3>Changes</h3>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time without
              prior notice. Please review this document especially before you provide any
              information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated below. Your
              continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy
              shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.

            <h3>More information on the use of Google Analytics</h3>
            <p>
              For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the option
              &quot;anonymizeIp&quot;. By means of this option, the IP address of the Internet
              connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymized when accessing our
              websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the
              Agreement on the European Economic Area.
            </p>
            <p>
              The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy,
              Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
            </p>
            <p>
              The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our
              website. Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the
              use to the application and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our
              websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for
              us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data
              subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie,
              Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the
              individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into
              which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the
              information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data
              through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the
              settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure,
              the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address
              of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of
              visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the
              location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by
              the data subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including
              the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to
              Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in
              the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through
              the technical procedure to third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our
              website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and
              thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet
              browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the
              information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use

              In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data
              that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website,
              as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such.
              For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link
              https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it. This browser add-on tells
              Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits
              of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the
              browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information technology
              system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the
              data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the
              browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is
              attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute
              the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.
