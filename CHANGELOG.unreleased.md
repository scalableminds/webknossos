## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/25.02.1...HEAD)

### Added
- Added support for datasets with the following data types: int8, int16, int32, uint32 (support for color was added, support for segmentation already existed before) and int64 (segmentation only). [#8325](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8325)
- Added a command palette that allows navigating between pages, switching tools and accessing some user settings via Ctrl+P. [#8447](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8447/)
- Super users can now share the trained AI models with other organizations. [#8418](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8418)
- Failed jobs may be retried by super-users. [#8377](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8377)
- Optimized server-side storage of skeleton annotation layers. [#8423](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8423)
- Added support for adding N5 datasets with compact-style multiscale metadata. [#8456](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8456)

### Changed
- When using a zarr link to a wk-served data layer as another layer’s source, the user’s token is used to access the data. [#8322](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8322/)
- Compound annotations (created when viewing all annotations of a task) no longer permanently store data in the FossilDB. [#8422](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8422)
- When creating multiple tasks at once (bulk task creation), they now all need to have the same task type. [#8405](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8405)
- Improved performance when changing the layout/viewports. [#8448](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8448)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that would lock a non-existing mapping to an empty segmentation layer under certain conditions. [#8401](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8401)
- Fixed the alignment of the button that allows restricting floodfill operations to a bounding box. [#8388](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8388) 
- Fixed rare bug where saving got stuck. [#8409](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8409)
- Fixed some rendering bugs for float datasets that used a large dynamic range. [#8325](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8325)
- Fixed a bug where reverting annotations could get stuck if some of its layers had been deleted in the meantime. [#8405](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8405)
- When removing a segment from the segment list, a corresponding precomputed mesh was not removed automatically. [#8428](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8428)
- Fixed a bug where newly added remote datasets would always appear in root folder, regardless of actual selected folder. [#8425](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8425)
- Fixed a bug where the python libs functionality `wk.RemoteDataset.explore_and_add_remote` would error. [#8425](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8425)
- Fixed a bug where various UI dialogs would be dark mode even the user preferred a light theme. [#8445](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8445)
- Fixed an issue with icon spacing on the task dashboard page. [#8452](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8452)
- Fixed a spacing issue in the statusbar. [#8455](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8455)
- Fixed a bug where the "Create Animation" modal did not open when selecting the corresponding feature from the navbar menu. [#8444](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8444)
- Fixed that the brightness/contrast settings (in the histogram) could not be changed if the histogram data could not be loaded for some reason. [#8459](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8459)
