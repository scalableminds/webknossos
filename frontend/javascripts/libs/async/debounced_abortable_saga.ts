 * In contrast to a normal debouncing mechanism, the saga
 * will be cancelled if F is called while the saga is running.
 * Note that this means that concurrent executions of the saga
 * are impossible that way (by design).
 *
 * Also note that the performance of this debouncing mechanism
 * is slower than a standard _.debounce. Also see
 * debounced_abortable_saga.spec.ts for a small benchmark.
