### Importing
Use the upload function in webKnossos:
* Recommended only for smaller datasets (max. 1 GB)
* Create a zip-file of dataset as specified above

File-system import:
* Place the dataset at `<webKnossos directory>/binaryData/<Organization name>/<Dataset name>`
* Wait for webKnossos to detect the dataset (up to 10min) or use the refresh button on the dashboard
* Go to the dataset view on the dashboard
* Click `Import` for your new dataset
* Review, correct and approve the dataset metadata. Usually, `scale` and `largestSegmentId` needs to be set manually.
