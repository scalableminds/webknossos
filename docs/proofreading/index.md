# Proofreading

WEBKNOSSOS offers several ways for proofreading large-scale, volumetric segmentations and reconstruction projects.

There are three proofreading workflows supported by WEBKNOSSOS:

1. The [Proofreading tool](tools.md) to correct large segmentations based on an underlying super-voxel graph. To use the proofreading tool, you need a [segmentation mapping](segmentation_mappings.md).
2. The [Merger-Mode tool](merger_mode.md)
