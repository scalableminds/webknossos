## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/20.11.0...HEAD)

### Added
- The total length of skeletons can now be measured using the dropdown in the tree list tab. Also, the frontend API received the methods `api.tracing.measureTreeLength` and `api.tracing.measureAllTrees`. [#4898](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4898)
- Introduced an indeterminate visibility state for groups in the tree tab if not all but only some of the group's children are visible. Before, the visibility of those groups was shown as not visible which made it hard to find the visible trees. [#4897](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4897)
- Dataset uploads on a specific Datastore can now be restricted to a single organization. [#4892](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4892)

### Changed
- In the tree tab, all groups but the root group are now collapsed instead of expanded when opening a tracing. [#4897](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4897)

### Fixed
- Fixed the disappearing of dataset settings after switching between view mode and annotation mode. [#4845](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4845)

### Removed
