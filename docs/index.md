# Welcome to WEBKNOSSOS

WEBKNOSSOS is an [open-source tool](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos) for [exploring](./tracing_ui.md) large 3D electron-microscopy (EM) and light-microscopy (LM) datasets as well as [collaboratively](./sharing.md) generating annotations.
The web-based tool is powered by a specialized data-delivery backend that stores [large datasets](./datasets.md) efficiently on disk and serves many concurrent users.
WEBKNOSSOS has a GPU-accelerated viewer that includes tools for creating and sharing skeleton and volume annotations.
Powerful [user](./users.md) and [task](./tasks.md) management features automatically distribute tasks to human annotators.
There are many features to enhance the productivity and efficiency of human annotators.
WEBKNOSSOS is also a platform for [showcasing datasets](https://webknossos.org) alongside a paper publication.

# Built for Science

WEBKNOSSOS is built for scientists with support by scientists. Our goal is to make image analysis and data exploration accessible and easy to use.
While originally designed for the annotation of electron microscopy of neural circuits, we have seen great projects using it to analyze MRI/CT scans, fluorescences microscopy images, and synchrotron datasets.

WEBKNOSSOS' impact on data annotation in neuroscience and Connectomics has been published in Nature Methods, 2017 and many other [publications](./publications.md):
