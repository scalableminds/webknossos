## Activating New Users
TODO revise this section

On private WEBKNOSSOS instances, users can only join through an email invitation.

If newly registered users did not join via an email invite link, they join a WEBKNOSSOS organization with the status "deactivated". An admin or a team manager needs to approve them and activate their user account before they can access anything on your WEBKNOSSOS instance. 
Users that registered within the last 14 days are shown above the `Users` list (accessible from the Admin menu) and can be activated quickly from there.
After that time or by default for any other inactive users, the `Users` list only shows active users, so make sure to deactivate the `Show Active Users Only` filter at the top of the user list to see/activate new users.


When activating new users, a popup opens for

  - team assignment
  - access role assignment
