# Converting Datasets
Any dataset uploaded through the web interface at [webknossos.org](https://webknossos.org) is automatically converted for compatibility.

For manual conversion, we provide the following software tools and libraries:

- The [WEBKNOSSOS CLI](https://docs.webknossos.org/cli) is a CLI tool that can convert many formats to WKW. 
- For other file formats, the [WEBKNOSSOS Python library](https://docs.webknossos.org/webknossos-py/index.html) can be an option for custom scripting.
