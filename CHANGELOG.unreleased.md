## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/22.06.0...HEAD)

### Added
Added a warning for when the resolution in the XY viewport on z=1-downsampled datasets becomes too low, explaining the problem and how to mitigate it. [#6255](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6255)

### Changed
- For the api routes that return annotation info objects, the user field was renamed to owner. User still exists as an alias, but will be removed in a future release. [#6250](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6250)
- When creating a task from a base annotation, the starting position/rotation and bounding box as specified during task creation are now used and overwrite the ones from the original base annotation. [#6249](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6249)

### Fixed
- Fixed that the context menu broke webKnossos when opening it in dataset-view-mode while no segmentation layer was visible. [#6259](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6259)
- Fixed benign error toast when viewing a public annotation without being logged in. [#6271](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6271)
