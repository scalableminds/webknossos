            Our Premium plan makes it simple for you to get started. We provide you with a fully

            Some clients prefer to store their datasets on-premise, within their infrastructure or

        <FAQItem title="What is the difference between Knossos and webKnossos?">
          <p>
            While webKnossos and Knossos share some of the roots, they are two distinct software
            tools for viewing and annotating 3D datasets developed by different teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            webKnossos supports a wide array of popular data formats (Knossos cubes, WKW,
            Neuroglancer Precomputed, BossDB, Tiff Stacks) and is used for creating both skeleton
            and volume annotations. As browser-based application, it is easy to share links to
            datasets and publish datasets for other to review.
