# Dashboard

The Dashboard is your entry point to webKnossos.
You can manage your datasets, create annotations, resume existing annotations and manage active tasks.

## My Datasets
This screen shows all the available and accessible datasets for a user.
You can **view** a dataset (read-only), or start new **skeleton** or **volume** annotations from this screen.
Search for your dataset by using the search bar or by sorting any of the table columns.
Learn more about managing datasets in the [Datasets guide](./datasets.md).

The presentation differs corresponding to your user role.
Regular users can only start or continue annotations and work on tasks.
[Admins and Team Managers](./users.md#access-rights-roles) also have access to additional administration actions, rights-managments, and advanced dataset properties for each dataset.

## My Tasks

With Tasks, you can coordinate large annotation projects with your users.
Tasks are small annotation work assignments that are automatically distributed to users. This particularly useful, when you have several users, such as working students, scientific assistances, outside collaborators etc, in your organisation that you can distribute the work to.

On the Task screen, users can request new tasks, continue to work on existing tasks, and finish tasks. These tasks will be assigned based on a user's experience level, project priority, and task availability.
Read more about the tasks feature in the [Tasks and Projects guide](./tasks.md).

## My Annotations
This screen lists all your skeleton or volume annotations that you started on a dataset (outside of tasks). Annotation are either created by starting new annotations from the "My Datasets" tab, from the webKnossos data viewer, or by uploading an existing annotation from your computer. (See [NML files](./data_formats.md#nml) for skeleton annotations.)

Annotations can be resumed, archived (soft "deleted"), and downloaded for offline analysis.
You can also add custom tags to annotations in order to organize and group them. 
Each annotation can be renamed to reflect its content.

## Shared Annotations
This screen shows all skeleton or volume annotations that were shared by other collaborators of your organization. Only annotations shared through the "Team Sharing" mechanic will be listed provided your user account is part of the respective team. Read more about sharing your own annotations in the [Sharing guide](./sharing.md#annotation-sharing).

You can view the linked annotations (read-only) or copy them to your account for modification.
