- Renamed "open" tasks to "pending" and slightly redesigned the available task assignment view for clarity. [#7187](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7187)
- Being the uploader of a dataset no longer grants edit permissions on that dataset. [#7200](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7200)
- Enabled the "Shift + middle-click" shortcut to load agglomerate skeletons for all tools, not just the Skeleton tool. [#7212](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7212)

### Fixed
- Fixed rare rendering bug at viewport edge for anisotropic datasets. [#7163](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7163)
- Fixed the dataset search which was broken when only the root folder existed. [#7177](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7177)
- Correctly use configured fill-value for missing chunks of remote datasets hosted on gcs or s3. [#7198](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7198)
- Correctly use configured fill-value for missing chunks of local non-wkw datasets. [#7216](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7216)

## [23.07.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/23.07.0) - 2023-06-20
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/23.06.0...23.07.0)

### Highlights
- Added new shortcuts for fast tool switching. Look at the updated [Keyboard Shortcuts documentation](https://docs.webknossos.org/webknossos/keyboard_shortcuts.html#tool-switching-shortcuts) to see the new shortcuts. [#7112](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7112)
- Creating bounding boxes can now be done by dragging the left mouse button (when the bounding box tool is selected). To move around in the dataset while this tool is active, keep ALT pressed. [#7118](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7118)

### Added
- Subfolders of the currently active folder are now also rendered in the dataset table in the dashboard. [#6996](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6996)
- Added ability to view [zarr v3](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v3/core/v3.0.html) datasets. [#7079](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7079)
- Added an index structure for volume annotation segments, in preparation for per-segment statistics. [#7063](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7063)

### Changed
- Agglomerate skeletons can only be modified if the proofreading tool is active so they stay in sync with the underlying segmentation and agglomerate graph. Agglomerate skeletons cannot be modified using any other means. They are marked in the skeleton list using the clipboard icon of the proofreading tool. When exporting skeletons in the NML format, trees ("things") now have a `type` property which is either "DEFAULT" or "AGGLOMERATE". [#7086](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7086)
- The cache for remote dataset array contents can now have a configured size in bytes. New config option `datastore.cache.imageArrayChunks.maxSizeBytes`. Default is 2 GB, consider increasing for production. [#7067](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7067)
- Optimized processing of parallel requests for remote datasets, improving performance and reducing idle waiting. [#7137](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7137)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where some volume annotations could not be downloaded. [#7115](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7115)
- Fixed reading of some remote datasets where invalid data would follow valid gzip data, causing the decompression to fail. [#7119](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7119)
- Fixed problems which could arise when annotating volume data at negative positions (which is not supported and is properly ignored now). [#7124](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7124)
- Fixed some requests failing for streaming remote data via HTTP, which was observed when streaming data via Zarr from another WEBKNOSSOS instance. [#7125](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7125)
- Fixed that the brush preview was inaccurate in some scenarios. [#7129](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7129)
- Fixed order of decompression on neuroglancer precomputed datasets, which caused some segmentation layers to not load correctly. [#7135](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7135/)

### Removed
- Support for [webknososs-connect](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos-connect) data store servers has been removed. Use the "Add Remote Dataset" functionality instead. [#7031](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7031)

### Added
- Added sign in via OIDC. [#6534](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6534)
- Added the option to search a specific folder in the new datasets tab. [#6677](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6677)
- The new datasets tab in the dashboard allows multi-selection of datasets so that multiple datasets can be moved to a folder at once. As in typical file explorers, CTRL + left click adds individual datasets to the current selection. Shift + left click selects a range of datasets. [#6683](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6683)

### Changed
- Bulk task creation now needs the taskTypeId, the task type summary will no longer be accepted. [#6640](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6640)
- Error handling and reporting is more robust now. [#6700](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6700)
- The Quick-Select settings are opened (and closed) automatically when labeling with the preview mode. That way, bulk labelings with preview mode don't require constantly opening the settings manually. [#6706](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6706)

### Fixed
- Fixed import of N5 datasets. [#6668](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6668)

### Breaking Changes


## [22.12.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/22.12.0) - 2022-11-24
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/22.11.2...22.12.0)

### Highlights
- Added a new Quick-Select tool for volume annotation. This tools allows to draw a rectangle over a segment to annotate it automatically. The tool operates on the intensity data of the visible color layer and automatically fills out the segment starting from the center of the rectangle. Next to the tool, there is a settings button which allows to enable a preview mode and to tweak some other parameters. If the preview is enabled, the parameters can be fine-tuned while the preview updates instantly. [#6542](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6542)
- The scale bar is now included in screenshots of the viewports made using the `Q` shortcut or the "Screenshot" menu entry. If the scale bar should not be included, disable it using "Settings - Viewport Options - Show Scalebars". [#6644](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6644)

### Added
- The largest segment id for a segmentation layer can be computed automatically from the dataset settings page. [#6415](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6415)
- Button for switching organizations for Voxelytics workflows. [#6572](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6572)
- Added ability to shuffle / set colors for a whole tree group. [#6586](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6586)
- Annotation layers can now be removed. [#6593](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6593)
- When adding remote Zarr datasets with multiple channels, channels are converted into layers. [#6609](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6609)
- When adding a remote OME-NGFF dataset with labels, these are added as segmentation layers. [#6638](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6638)
- When creating an annotation from the dataset view, a previously selected mapping of the segmentation layer is now automatically selected in the volume annotation layer fallback segmentation as well. [#6647](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6647)

### Changed
- The log viewer in the Voxelytics workflow reporting now uses a virtualized list. [#6579](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6579)
- Node positions are always handled as integers. They have always been persisted as integers by the server, anyway, but the session in which a node was created handled the position as floating point in earlier versions. [#6589](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6589)
- Jobs can no longer be started on datastores without workers. [#6595](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6595)
- When downloading volume annotations with volume data skipped, the nml volume tag is now included anyway (but has no location attribute in this case). [#6566](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6566)
- Re-phrased some backend (error) messages to improve clarity and provide helping hints. [#6616](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6616)
- The layer visibility is now encoded in the sharing link. The user opening the link will see the same layers that were visible when copying the link. [#6634](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6634)
- Voxelytics workflows can now be viewed by anyone with the link who is in the right organization. [#6622](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6622)
- Improve performance for handling of volume annotation data (saving/undo/redo). [#6652](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6652)
- When importing an annotation into an existing annotation, webKnossos ensures that bounding boxes are not duplicated in case they exist in the current *and* imported annotation. [#6648](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6648)
- Reworked the proofreading mode so that agglomerate skeletons are no longer needed (nor automatically loaded). Instead, segments can be selected by left-clicking onto them, indicated by a small white cross. To merge or split agglomerates, then either use the shortcuts `Shift + Leftclick`/`Ctrl + Leftclick` or use the context menu. [#6625](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6625)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in the dataset import view, where the layer name text field would lose focus after each key press. [#6615](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6615)
- Fixed importing NGFF Zarr datasets with non-scale transforms. [#6621](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6621)
- Fixed a regression in NGFF Zarr import for datasets with no channel axis. [#6636](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6636)
- Fixed broken creation of tasks using base NMLs. [#6634](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6634)
- Fixed that the precomputation of meshes didn't take the active mapping into account. [#6651](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6651)
- Fixed false-positive warning about an outdated annotation version. [#6656](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6656)
- Fixed that segment statistics seemed to be available but broken for segments without index. [#7377](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7377)

- Improved performance for applying agglomerate mappings on segmentation data. [#6532](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6532)
- Added backspace as an additional keyboard shortcut for deleting the active node. [#6554](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6554)
- When reloading a layer, because the underlying data has changed, the histogram will also be reloaded and reflect the changes. [#6537](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6537)
- Enable "What's New" update information for all instances. [#6563](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6563)
- Add context-menu option to delete skeleton root group. [#6553](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6553)
- Added remaining task time estimation (ETA) for Voxelytics tasks in workflow reporting. [#6564](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6564)
- Added a help button to the UI to send questions and feedbacks to the dev team. [#6560](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6560)

### Changed
- Creating tasks in bulk now also supports referencing task types by their summary instead of id. [#6486](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6486)
- Navbar changes: Move dropdown menu into separate Menu button. Removed toggle-button (cog icon)for left-hand side bar from navbar. [#6558](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6558)
- Upgraded Typescript to v4.8 [#6567](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6567)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where some file requests replied with error 400 instead of 404, confusing some zarr clients. [#6515](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6515)
- Fixed URL for private Zarr streaming links to volume annotations. [#6515](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6541)

- Fixed a bug where some features were unavailable for annotations for datasets of foreign organizations. [#6548](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6548)

## [22.10.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/22.10.0) - 2022-09-27
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/22.09.0...22.10.0)

### Highlights
- Added a context menu option to extract the shortest path between two nodes as a new tree. Select the source node and open the context menu by right-clicking on another node in the same tree. [#6423](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6423)
- Add setting for gamma correction for color and grayscale layers in the left sidebar. [#6439](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6439)
- Added a context menu option to separate an agglomerate skeleton using Min-Cut. Activate the Proofreading tool, select the source node and open the context menu by right-clicking on the target node which you would like to separate through Min-Cut. [#6361](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6361)
- The color of a segments can now be changed in the segments tab. Rightclick a segment in the list and select "Change Color" to open a color picker. [#6372](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6372)
- Sharing links are shortened by default. Within the sharing modal, this shortening behavior can be disabled. [#6461](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6461)
- The largestSegmentId is no longer a required property for segmentation layers. It is still recommended to set the property, since the generation of new segment IDs is blocked during volume annotation. However, annotating with manually set IDs is still possible. This change simplifies the import of datasets into webKnossos. [#6414](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6414)

### Added
- Zarr-based remote dataset import now also works for public AWS S3 endpoints with no credentials. [#6421](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6421)
- Added a "clear" button to reset skeletons/meshes after successful mergers/split. [#6459](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6459)
- The proofreading tool now supports merging and splitting (via min-cut) agglomerates by right-clicking a segment (and not a node). Note that there still has to be an active node so that both partners of the operation are defined. [#6464](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6464)
- Added workflow reporting and logging features for Voxelytics into webKnossos. If activated, the workflows can be accessed from the `Administration` > `Voxelytics` menu item. [#6416](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6416) [#6460](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6460)
- Added possibility to read N5 datasets. [#6466](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6466)
- Added "shift + w" shortcut to cycle backwards through annotation tools. [#6493](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6493)

### Changed
- Selecting a node with the proofreading tool won't have any side effects anymore. Previous versions could load additional agglomerate skeletons in certain scenarios which could be confusing. [#6477](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6477)
- Removed optional "resolution" parameter from /datasets/:organizationName/:dataSetName/layers/:dataLayerName/data route. Use mag instead. [#6479](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6479)
- Changed how volumes containing no data are stored. Now the selection of magnifications is correctly exported and imported. [#6481](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6481)
- The "Restore Older Version" list is now paginated which improves performance for in case many versions exist. [#6483](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6483)

### Fixed
- Fixed sharing button for users who are currently visiting a dataset or annotation which was shared with them. [#6438](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6438)
- Fixed the duplicate function for annotations with an editable mapping (a.k.a. supervoxel proofreading) layer. [#6446](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6446)
- Fixed isosurface loading for volume annotations with mappings. [#6458](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6458)
- Fixed importing of remote datastore (e.g., zarr) when datastore is set up separately. [#6462](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6462)
- Fixed a crash which could happen when using the "Automatically clip histogram" feature in certain scenarios. [#6433](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6433)
- Fixed loading agglomerate skeletons for agglomerate ids larger than 2^31. [#6472](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6472)
- Fixed bug which could lead to conflict-warnings even though there weren't any. [#6477](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6477)
- Fixed that one could not change the color of a segment or tree in Firefox. [#6488](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6488)
- Fixed validation of layer selection when trying to start globalization of floodfills. [#6497](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6497)
- Fixed filtering for public datasets in dataset table. [#6496](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6496)

## [22.09.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/22.09.0) - 2022-08-25
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/22.08.0...22.09.0)

### Highlights
- Added an "extrude segment" feature which is similar to the old "copy from previous slice" feature. The segment interpolation and the new segment extrusion feature are both available via the toolbar (see the dropdown icon which was added to the old interpolation button). [#6370](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6370)
- The owner of an annotation can allow other users, who may see the annotation, to also edit it. Note that parallel writes are not supported and would lead to conflicts. [#6236](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6236)
- Added support for ad-hoc meshing for volume annotation layers with fallback segmentations. [#6369](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6369)
- Added support for 64-bit segmentations (uint64). Note that the actual support only covers IDs up to 2^53 - 1 (matches the JavaScript number type). Also note that JSON mappings are only compatible with segment ids that only use the lower 32 bits. [#6317](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6317)
- WebKnossos now remembers the tool that was active in between disabling and enabling the segmentation layer. [#6362](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6362)
- The Add Dataset view now hosts an Add Zarr Dataset tab to explore, configure and import remote Zarr datasets. [#6335](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6335)
- Added a UI to manage Zarr links for an annotation so that the annotation can be streamed to third-party tools. This change also includes new backend API routes for using the (private) zarr links to annotations as well as creating them. [#6367](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6367)

### Added
- Segmentation layers which were not previously editable now show an (un)lock icon button which shortcuts to the Add Volume Layer modal with the layer being preselected. [#6330](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6330)
- The NML file in volume annotation download now includes segment metadata like names and anchor positions. [#6347](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6347)
- Added new backend API route for requesting all publications. Those publications can now have also attached annotations. [#6315](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6315)
- Added a "duplicate" button for annotations. [#6386](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6386)
- Added new filter options for the dataset list api at `api/datasets`: `organizationName: String`, `onlyMyOrganization: Boolean`, `uploaderId: String` [#6377](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6377)

### Changed
- webKnossos uses WebGL 2 instead of WebGL 1 now. In case your browser/hardware does not support this, webKnossos will alert you and you need to upgrade your system. [#6350](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6350)
- The sharing modal now automatically saves changes of the sharing options. [#6314](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6314)
- The Layers tab now displays an Add Skeleton Annotation Layer button with which volume-only annotations can be converted to hybrid annotations. [#6330](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6330)
- The Zarr directory listings no longer include the current directory “.”. [6359](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6359)
- The default name for volume annotation layers with fallback segmentations is now set to the name of their fallback segmentation layer, no longer “Volume”. [#6373](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6373)
- The “reload data” button for dataset and annotation layers is now only shown to users who have administrative permissions for the dataset (because the button clears server caches and file handles). [#6380](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6380)
- Requests for missing chunks in zarr datasets now return status code 404 instead of 200 with an empty response. [#6381](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6381)
- Dataset layer thumbnails now by default show the center of the intersection of all layer bounding boxes, so all layer thumbnails show the same region. [6411](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6411)

### Fixed
- Fixed a regression where the mapping activation confirmation dialog was never shown. [#6346](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6346)
- Fixed an error if multiple proofreading actions were performed in rapid succession. If webKnossos is busy, inputs to the viewports are disabled from now on. [#6325](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6325)
- Fixed that ad-hoc meshing would terminate early for large segments. [#6352](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6352)
- Fixed a bug where the largestSegmentId of zarr segmentation layers was not propagated from the datasource-properties.json, which broke annotating based on these layers. [#6363](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6363)
- Fixed a bug where uploads of wkw datasets with numerical-only layer names would fail. [#6382](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6382)
- Public datasets of other organizations are no longer listed during task creation. [#6377](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6377)
- Tightened organization isolation security for dataset uploads. [#6378](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6378)
- Fixed a bug with undo/redo and volume interpolation/extrusion. [#6403](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6403)
- Fixed a regression which caused that uint16 and uint8 segmentations could not be rendered. [#6406](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6406)
- Fixed a bug which prevented keyboard shortcuts from taking affect after expanding/collapsing the sidebar panels using the button icons.[#6410](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6410)
- Fixed a bug with the clip histogram button to prevent it from showing a loading spinner forever in some cases. [#6407](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6407)
- Fixed an issue whereby a warning toast would be triggered every time the 3D viewport is put into fullscreen mode. [#6412](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6412)

### Removed
- The Annotation Type label was removed from the info tab. [#6330](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6330)
- Removed the possibility to load data from foreign webKnossos datastores. Use Zarr streaming instead. [#6392](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6392)

## [22.08.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/22.08.0) - 2022-07-20
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/22.07.0...22.08.0)

### Highlights
- Merged the "Shared Annotations" tab into the "Annotations" tab in the user's dashboard. If annotations are shared with you, you can see them in your dashboard. The table can be filtered by owner if you prefer to see only your own annotations. [#6230](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6230)
- Add new backend API routes for working with annotations without having to provide a 'type' argument. Note that these support stored annotations (Task and Explorational), but do not work for CompoundTask/CompoundProject/CompoundTaskType annotations. For the latter, please use the original route variants with explicit type. [#6285](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6285)

### Added
- Added a warning for invalid volume layer names. The layer names must now be unique among all layers in an annotation and must not contain url encoded special characters. [#6289](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6289)
- Added optional mappingName parameter to `requestRawCuboid` datastore route, which allows to directly apply a specified mapping in the backend. [#6311](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6311)
- Added option to use `X-Auth-Token` header instead of query parameter in every datastore and tracingstore route. [#6312](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6312)

### Changed
- Changed the name of the volume annotation layer in tasks to be "Volume" instead of "Volume Layer". [#6321](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6321)
- Dataset managers are now allowed to change dataset team permissions for all teams they are a member of. [#6336](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6336)

### Fixed
- Fixed that zooming out for datasets with very large scale was not possible until the coarsest level. [#6304](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6304)

## [22.07.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/22.07.0) - 2022-06-28
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/22.06.1...22.07.0)

### Highlights
- Added a image data download speed indicator to the statusbar. On hover a tooltip is shown that show the total amount of downloaded shard data. [#6269](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6269)
- Provide a UI to download/export a dataset in view-mode. The UI explains how to access the data with the python library. [#6283](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6283)

### Added
- Added a warning for when the resolution in the XY viewport on z=1-downsampled datasets becomes too low, explaining the problem and how to mitigate it. [#6255](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6255)
- Added the possibility to view and download older versions of read-only annotations. [#6274](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6274)
- Added a proofreading tool which can be used to edit agglomerate mappings. After activating an agglomerate mapping the proofreading tool can be selected. While the tool is active, agglomerates can be clicked to load their agglomerate skeletons. Use the context menu to delete or create edges for those agglomerate skeletons to split or merge agglomerates. The changes will immediately reflect in the segmentation and meshes. [#6195](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6195)

### Changed
- For the api routes that return annotation info objects, the user field was renamed to owner. User still exists as an alias, but will be removed in a future release. [#6250](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6250)
- Slimmed the URLs for annotations by removing `Explorational` and `Task`. The old URLs are still supported, but will be redirected to the new format. [#6208](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6208)
- When creating a task from a base annotation, the starting position/rotation and bounding box as specified during task creation are now used and overwrite the ones from the original base annotation. [#6249](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6249)
- Increased maximum interpolation depth from 8 to 100. [#6292](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6292)

### Fixed
- Fixed that bounding boxes were deletable in read-only tracings although the delete button was disabled. [#6273](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6273)
- Fixed that (old) sharing links with tokens did not work, because the token was removed during a redirection. [#6281](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6281)

## [22.06.1](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/22.06.1) - 2022-06-16
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/22.06.0...22.06.1)

### Fixed
- Fixed that the context menu broke webKnossos when opening it in dataset-view-mode while no segmentation layer was visible. [#6259](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6259)
- Fixed benign error toast when viewing a public annotation without being logged in. [#6271](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6271)

## [22.06.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/22.06.0) - 2022-05-27
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/22.05.1...22.06.0)

### Highlights
- Added a volume interpolation feature. When triggering the interpolation, the current segment id is interpolated between the current slice and the slice which was annotated last. Note that the feature is forbidden for tasks by default, but can be enabled/recommended. The feature can be used via a button in the toolbar or via the shortcut V. [#6162](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6162) and [#6235](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6235)
- Removed the feature to copy a segment from the previous/next slice with the V shortcut. Use the new volume interpolation feature instead (also bound to V and available via the toolbar). [#6235](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6235)
- Selecting "Download" from the annotation actions now opens a new modal, which lets the user select data for download, start TIFF export jobs or copy code snippets to get started quickly with the webKonossos Python Client. [#6171](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6171)
- Added a long-running job that materializes annotations as datasets. It merges volume annotations with their base segmentation layer and it applies “merger mode” annotations, allowing to agglomerate segments. Access this feature from the layers sidebar. When merger mode is active, an additional button is shown in the tool bar. [#6086](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6086)

### Added
- Added a batching mechanism to the task creation via NML to support uploading more than 100 NMLs at a time. [#6216](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6216)
- Added support to stream zarr files using the corresponding [zarr spec](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/v2.html#storage). [#6144](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6144)
- Added support to stream volume annotations as a zarr data set. [#6203](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6203)
- Added segmentation layers to the functionality catching the case that more layers are active that the hardware allows. This prevents rendering issue with more than one segmentation layer and multiple color layers. [#6211](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6211)
- Adding a New Volume Layer via the left border tab now gives the option to restrict resolutions for the new layer. [#6229](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6229)
- Added Route to get OME-NGFF Headers for a data layer (.zattrs file) following the corresponding [spec](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/latest/). [#6226](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6226)
- Added Route to get OME-NGFF Headers for Volume annotation. [#6242](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6242)

### Changed
- When creating a new annotation with a volume layer (without fallback) for a dataset which has an existing segmentation layer, the original segmentation layer is still listed (and viewable) in the left sidebar. Earlier versions simply hid the original segmentation layer. [#6186](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6186)
- Changing the visibility of a layer within an annotation does not change the visibility of the layer when viewing the corresponding dataset. [#6186](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6186)
- While viewing tracings in read-only mode, the options to manipulate the tracing are now disabled. This leads to less confusion as previously the input was silently discarded. [#6140](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6140).
- Changed default of `dynamicSpaceDirection` property to false to avoid confusion. [#6162](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6162)
- Changed the internal protocol for requesting image data. The zoomStep parameter has been replaced by mag. This increases the datastore API version to 2.0 [#6159](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6159)
- In annotation list in dashboard, replaced the non-standard word “Trace” by “Open”. [#6191](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6191)
- Tiff export via webknossos-worker is now allowed for all datasets that a (logged-in) user can see, no longer only for datasets of their own organization. [#6219](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6219)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in the task creation, where creation for some tasks with initial volume data would fail. [#6178](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6178)
- Fixed a rendering bug which could cause an incorrect magnification to be rendered in rare scenarios. [#6029](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6029)
- Fixed a bug which could cause a segmentation layer's "ID mapping" dropdown to disappear. [#6215](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6215)
- Fixed the 3d viewport for datasets with low voxel resolution by making the camera far clipping adaptive to the dataset extent. [#6221](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6221).
- Fixed a non-critical error message when resizing the browser window while webKnossos loaded a dataset or annotation. [#6247](https://github.com/scalableminds)

## [22.05.1](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/22.05.1) - 2022-04-29
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/22.05.0...22.05.1)

### Fixed
- Fixed applying recommended settings when starting a task which provides recommended settings. [#6175](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6175)

### Removed
 - Removed the option to download sample-datasets. To explore webKnossos, use the public sample datasets on webknossos.org. [#6151](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6151)

### Breaking Changes


## [22.05.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/22.05.0) - 2022-04-26
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/22.04.0...22.05.0)

### Highlights
- The mouse cursor now changes appearance to indicate the currently selected annotation tool  [#6132](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6132)

### Changed
- Various changes to the Dataset table in the dashboard  [#6131](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6131):
  - Renamed "Allowed Teams" column to "Access Permissions".
  - Add filter functionality to "Access Permissions" column to filter for public datasets.
  - Removed `isActive` and `isPublic` columns to save screen space.
  - Changed data layer entries to display layer names instead of categories, e.g. "color" --> "axons".
- Moved the list of "user with access to the selected dataset" from the dashboard to the respective dataset's settings (Sharing Tab). [#6166](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6166)
- Sped up initial requests for remote zarr dataset by using asynchronous caching. [#6165](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6165)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that led to an error when drag-'n'-dropping an empty volume annotation in the dataset view. [#6116](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6116)
- Fixed rare callstack overflow when annotating large areas. [#6076](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6076)
- Fixed the "Copy Slice" shortcut (`v` and `shift + v`) in resolutions other than the most detailed one. [#6130](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6130)
- Fixed a bug where dataset tags with spaces would be automatically wrapped in quotes. [#6159](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6159)
- Fixed a bug where during dataset upload, un-sorted anisotropic mags in the datasource-properties.json could lead to errors. [#6167](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6167)

### Removed
- Removed the functionality to unlink the fallback layer from an existing segmentation layer. Either create an annotation without fallback layer or from within an annotation with a fallback layer, create a new volume layer, instead. [#6146](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6146)

### Breaking Changes


## [22.04.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/22.04.0) - 2022-03-22
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/22.03.0...22.04.0)

### Highlights
- The visible meshes are now included in the link copied from the "Share" modal or the "Share" button next to the dataset position. They are automatically loaded for users that open the shared link. [#5993](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5993)
- Added a new "Connectome Tab" which can be used to explore connectomes by visualizing neurites and their synaptic connections. Connectome files need to be placed in a `connectomes` folder inside of the respective segmentation layer. It is possible to craft links that automatically load specific agglomerates and their synapses when openend. For more information refer to https://docs.webknossos.org/webknossos/sharing.html#sharing-link-format. [#5894](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5894)

### Added
- Added a context-menu option when right-clicking on skeleton trees to hide/show all other trees but the selected one. Great for inspecting a single tree in isolation. Identical to keyboard shortcut "2". [#6102](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6102)
- Added support for reading Zarr image data. [#6019](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6019)

### Changed
- The maximum brush size now depends on the available magnifications. Consequentially, one can use a larger brush size when the magnifications of a volume layer are restricted. [#6066](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6066)
- Improved stability and speed of volume annotations when annotating large areas. [#6055](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6055)
- In dataset upload, linking layers of existing datasets is no longer restricted to public datasets. [#6097](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6097)
- Deactivating users with currently active tasks is no longer allowed. [#6099](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6099)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that led to crashing the layer settings once the icon for the downsample modal was clicked. [#6058](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6058)
- Fixed a bug where toggling between not archived and archived annotations in the "My Annotation" of the dashboard led to inconsistent states and duplicates of annotations. [#6058](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6058)
- Fixed a bug where deactivated users would still be listed as allowed to access the datasets of their team. [#6070](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6070)
- Fixed occasionally "disappearing" data. [#6055](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6055)
- Fixed a bug where remote-origin headers were omitted in error case. [#6098](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6098)
- Increased the timeouts for some internal operations like downsampling volume annotations. [#6103](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6103)
- Fixed a bug where there was a suggested change in the `datasource-config.json` was shown for resolution `1` instead of `[1,1,1]` or vice-versa. [#6104](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6104)

### Removed
- The previously disabled Import Skeleton Button has been removed. The functionality is available via the context menu for datasets with active ID mappings. [#6073](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6073)
- Removes experimental (and hidden) automatic brushing feature. Consequentially, the corresponding feature flag `autoBrushReadyDatasets` is not used, anymore. [#6107](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6107)

- Running uploads can now be cancelled. [#5958](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5958)
- Annotations with multiple volume layers can now be uploaded. (Note that merging multiple annotations with multiple volume layers each is not supported.) [#6028](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6028)
- Decrease volume annotation download latency by using a different compression level. [#6036](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6036)

### Changed
- Upgraded webpack build tool to v5 and all other webpack related dependencies to their latest version. Enabled persistent caching which speeds up server restarts during development as well as production builds. [#5969](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5969)
- Improved stability when quickly volume-annotating large structures. [#6000](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6000)
- The front-end API `labelVoxels` returns a promise now which resolves as soon as the label operation was carried out. [#5955](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5955)
- webKnossos no longer tries to reach a save state where all updates are sent to the backend to be in sync with the frontend when the save is triggered by a timeout. [#5999](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5999)
- When changing which layers are visible in an annotation, this setting is persisted in the annotation, so when you share it, viewers will see the same visibility configuration. [#5967](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5967)
- Downloading public annotations is now also allowed without being authenticated. [#6001](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6001)
- Downloaded volume annotation layers no longer produce zero-byte zipfiles but rather a valid header-only zip file with no contents. [#6022](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6022)
- Changed a number of API routes from GET to POST to avoid unwanted side effects. [#6023](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6023)
- Removed unused datastore route `checkInbox` (use `checkInboxBlocking` instead). [#6023](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6023)
- Migrated to Google Analytics 4. [#6031](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/6031)

- Added the possibility to cancel running webknossos-worker jobs. [#5946](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5946)
- Partially executed floodfills can now be finished by starting a worker job from the bounding box tab (requires a webKnossos instance where jobs are set up). [#5905](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5905)

### Changed
- Improved the UI for automatic suggestions to the datasource properties when editing a dataset. [#5948](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5948)

### Fixed
- Fixed bug where volume data downloads would sometimes produce invalid zips due to a race condition. [#5926](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5926)
- Fixed a bug which caused that the keyboard delay wasn't respected properly when rapidly pressing a key. [#5947](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5947)
- Fixed that navigating away from uploading a dataset properly warns the user that there is unsaved state. [#5948](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5948)

### Breaking Changes


## [22.01.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/22.01.0) - 2022-01-04
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/21.11.2...22.01.0)

### Highlights
- Added tagging support for datasets. [#5832](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5832)

### Added
- Dataset upload back-end now supports linking layers of existing public datasets. [#5863](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5863)
- Activate the correct mapping before loading pre-computed meshes if the corresponding mesh file contains that information. [#5859](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5859)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where dataset uploads that contained files larger than 2 GB failed. [#5889](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5889)
- Fixed that dataset uploads did not survive back-end restarts. [#5831](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5831)
- Fixed a bug where NMLs with unconnected trees and nested tree groups could not be uploaded due to wrong tree group IDs. [#5893](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5893)
- Fixed a security vulnerability by upgrading log4j to the newest version. [#5900](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5900)

### Breaking Change
- When using the front-end API, functions that accept a layer name, such as `api.data.getDataValue`, won't interpret the name "segmentation" as the current volume tracing if it exists. Instead, "segmentation" can only be used if the current dataset has a layer which is named "segmentation". If you want to interact with the volume tracing layer, use `api.data.getVolumeTracingLayerIds()` instead. Also see `api.data.getSegmentationLayerNames` and `api.data.getVisibleSegmentationLayer`. [#5771](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5771)
- The datastore server routes `/datasets/reserveUpload` and `/datasets/finishUpload` now expect the additional field `layersToLink`, which should be an empty list by default. [#5863](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5863)


## [21.11.2](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/21.11.2) - 2021-12-21
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/21.11.1...21.11.2)

### Fixed
- Fixed a security vulnerability by upgrading log4j to newest version (2.17.0). [#5913](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5913)

## [21.11.1](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/21.11.1) - 2021-12-16
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/21.11.0...21.11.1)

### Fixed
- Fixed a security vulnerability by upgrading log4j to newest version (2.15.0). [#5900](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5900)

## [21.11.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/21.11.0) - 2021-11-30
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/21.10.0...21.11.0)

### Highlights
- Added a new bounding box tool that allows resizing and creating bounding boxes more easily. Additionally, the context menu now contains options to modify the bounding box close to the clicked position. [#5767](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5767)

### Changed
- The docker setup has been restructured, which requires changes to existing docker-compose setups. See the migration guide for details. [#5843](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5843)
- By default, if data is missing in one magnification, higher magnifications are used for rendering. This setting can be controlled via the left sidebar under "Render Missing Data Black". [#5862](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5862)
- Made the `w` shortcut to cycle through the tools non-looping. [#5865](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5865)
- The communication with webknossos-worker for long-running jobs no longer uses flower/celery, but instead webKnossos itself assigns jobs to polling workers. [#5834](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5834)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that the displayed value range of a histogram of a color layer wasn't applied until the slider was dragged a bit. [#5853](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5853)
- Fixed a bug where admins could not share annotations with teams they were not explicitly a member of. [#5845](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5845)

### Removed
- Removed `1` shortcut which allowed to cycle through the tools but only if some of the tools were active. Use `w` instead. [#5865](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5865)

## [21.10.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/21.10.0) - 2021-11-08
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/21.09.0...21.10.0)

### Highlights
- A new "Segments" tab was added which replaces the old "Meshes" tab. The tab renders a list of segments within a volume annotation for the visible segmentation layer. The list "grows" while creating an annotation or browsing a dataset. For example, selecting an existing segment or drawing with a new segment id will both ensure that the segment is listed. Via right-click, meshes can be loaded for a selected segment. The mesh will be added as child to the segment. [#5696](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5696)
- Enhanced the volume fill tool to so that it operates beyond the dimensions of the current viewport. Additionally, the fill tool can also be changed to perform in 3D instead of 2D. [#5733](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5733)
- The active mapping is now included in the link copied from the "Share" modal or the new "Share" button next to the dataset position. It is automatically activated for users that open the shared link. [#5738](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5738)

### Added
- Added the possibility to load the skeletons of specific agglomerates from an agglomerate file when opening a tracing by including a mapping and agglomerate ids in the URL hash. See the [docs](https://docs.webknossos.org/webknossos/sharing.html#sharing-link-format) for further information. [#5738](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5738)
- Added a skeleton sandbox mode where a dataset can be opened and all skeleton tracing capabilities are available. However, by default changes are not saved. At any point, users can decide to copy the current state to their account. The sandbox can be accessed at `<webknossos_host>/datasets/<organization>/<dataset>/sandbox/skeleton`. In the combination with the new agglomerate skeleton loading feature this can be used to craft links that open webknossos with an activated mapping and specific agglomerates loaded on-demand. [#5738](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5738)
- For ad-hoc mesh computation and for mesh precomputation, the user can now select which quality the mesh should have (i.e., via selecting which magnification should be used). [#5696](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5696)
- The context menu in the data viewport also allows to compute an ad-hoc mesh for the selected segment. [#5696](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5696)

### Changed
- Improved the movement behavior when using shortcuts to navigate along the 3rd dimension. Instead of clamping the sub-voxel position to .0 or .99 on the initial movement, the keyboard delay is adapted dynamically to avoid too fast movements. This change especially improves the move behavior when quickly changing the direction backwards/forwards. [#5801](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5801)

### Fixed
- Fixed two volume tracing related bugs which could occur when using undo with a slow internet connection or when volume-annotating more than 5000 buckets (32**3 vx) in one session. [#5728](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5728)
- Jobs status is no longer polled if jobs are not enabled, avoiding backend logging spam [#5761](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5761)
- Fixed a bug that windows user could not open the context menu as it instantly closed after opening. [#5756](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5756).
- Fixed a bug where the health check of public datasets failed if no cookie/token was supplied. [#5768](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5768).
- Fixed a bug where retried save requests could lead to a 409 CONFLICT error if the first request was already handled by the back-end. [#5779](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5779).
- Fixed a bug where volume annotations could not be saved under certain circumstances (if "Render Missing Data Black" was disabled and a data bucket was annotated for the first time). [#5783](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5783)
- Fixed a bug which made the ad-hoc mesh loading abort too early. [#5696](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5696)
- Fixed that viewports turned black when zoomed in very much. [#5797](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5797)
- Fixed the bucket loading order in the YZ and XZ viewports. Data in these viewports will be rendered faster than before. [#5798](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5798)
- Fixed that collapsing/expanding the sidebars did not work for touchscreens. [#5825](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5825)
- Fixed a bug where projects could not be listed if the tracing time got too large. [#5823](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5823)

## [21.09.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/21.09.0) - 2021-10-01
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/21.08.0...21.09.0)

### Highlights
- Added shortcuts K and L for toggling the left and right sidebars. [#5709](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5709)
- Added support for datasets that have multiple segmentation layers. Note that only one segmentation layer can be rendered at a time, currently. [#5683](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5683)

### Added
- Added a rudimentary version of openAPI docs for some routes. Available at `/swagger.json`. [#5693](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5693)

### Changed
- By default, if data is missing in one magnification, higher magnifications are used for rendering. This setting can be controlled via the left sidebar under "Render Missing Data Black". [#5703](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5703)
- Refactor the format of the URL hash/fragment to alternatively use JSON. Old links will continue to work. [#5730](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5730)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where existing tasktypes with recommended configurations still had a property that is no longer valid. [#5707](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5707)
- Fixed that segment IDs could not be copied to the clipboard. [#5709](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5709)
- Fixed a bug where volume annotation version restore skipped buckets that were not yet touched in the version to be restored. [#5717](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5717)
- Fixed a rendering bug showing non-existent or wrongly-colored edges that sometimes occurred after deleting edges, nodes, or trees. [#5724](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5724)
- Fixed an error during viewport maximization in flight mode. Also, fixed a crash during minimization of the 3D-View for datasets with lots of magnifications. [#5746](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5746)

## [21.08.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/21.08.0) - 2021-08-26
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/21.07.0...21.08.0)

### Highlights
- Added the possibility to restrict the volume resolutions when creating explorative annotations. Use this to annotate larger structures without creating tons of high-res data. [#5645](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5645)
- Most recent dataset conversions are shown in dashboard (if the webKnossos instance supports processing jobs). [#5597](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5597)
- Added UI to infer nuclei for webknossos instances that support jobs (e.g., webknossos.org). [#5669](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5669)

### Added
- Fixed a bug where non-existing resolutions could be selected for wk-worker-based meshfile computations [#5631](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5631)
- Added new mesh-related functions to the front-end API: getAvailableMeshFiles, getActiveMeshFile, setActiveMeshFile, loadPrecomputedMesh, computeMeshOnDemand, setMeshVisibility, removeMesh. [#5634](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5634)
- Added a route to call new webknossos-worker job for nuclei inferral. [#5626](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5626)
- Added shortcut information to the context menu. Some shortcuts that are only available for the classic controls are only shown when the classic controls are active. [#5677](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5677)
- For webknossos.org, a "What's New" notification was added to the navbar. [#5665](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5665)
- Added tooltips for all elements of the Settings tab in the left sidebar. [#5673](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5673)

### Changed
- Improved context menu for interactions with segmentation data that wasn't loaded completely, yet. [#5637](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5637)
- Any feature connected to computational jobs like precomputing a meshfile is now disabled for non local hosted datasets. [#5663](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5663)
- Clicking outside of the context menu closes it without performing any other action (e.g., previously, a node could be created when clicking outside of the context menu, when the skeleton tool was active). Also, a repeated right-click doesn't open the context menu again. [#5658](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5658)
- When the option "Rendering missing data black" is turned of, the fallback data is now shown up to a zoom difference of 3. Previously it was 1. [#5674](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5674)

### Fixed
- Fixed that active segment and node id were not shown in status bar in a non-hybrid annotation. [#5638](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5638)
- Fixed that setting an intensity range of a color layer to 0 via the histogram slider led to no data being rendered at all. [#5676](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5676)
- Fixed that "Compute Mesh File" button was enabled in scenarios where it should not be supported (e.g., when no segmentation layer exists). [#5648](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5648)
- Fixed a bug where an authentication error was shown when viewing the meshes tab while not logged in. [#5647](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5647)
- Fixed that segment id 0 was always shown even when fallback data of the segmentation layer was visible and hovered with the mouse. [#5674](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5674)
- Fixed that nodes could only be selected via the context menu when an annotation was opened in read-only mode. Shift-Click will now work, too (and if "Classic Controls" are disabled, a simple left click will work, too). [#5661](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5661)
- Fixed that the copy buttons in the context menu did not work properly. [#5658](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5658)
- Fixed that the position of the mouse displayed in the statusbar was not updated properly when navigating via the keyboard. [#5670](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/issues/5670)
- Fixed that creating a new node in merger mode did always turn off the "Hide unmapped segments" setting. [#5668](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5668)
- Fixed that undo in volume annotations might overwrite the backend data on not loaded magnifications with zeros. [#5608](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5608)
- Fixed a bug where volume annotation downloads were occasionally cancelled with “Connection reset by peer” error. [#5660](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5660)
- Fixed that the ad-hoc mesh computation was disabled for volume annotations. [#5689](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5689)

### Breaking Change
- The interface of the cross-origin API changed. The initialization message is no longer an object with a `message` property of "api ready", but instead an object with a `type` property of "init". Additionally, if an API call finishes, a return message of type "ack" is sent. If the original API call contained a `messageId` property, the return message will contain the same `messageId` to allow to match the return message. If the API call is misformatted, a return message of `type` "err" is sent, containing an error message in the `message` property.

## [21.07.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/21.07.0) - 2021-07-21
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/21.06.0...21.07.0)

### Highlights
- Several improvements and changes have been implemented for the toolbar, sidebar and status bar. See the full changelog for all details (grouped under #5384). Alternatively, read the corresponding [blog post](https://medium.com/scalableminds/making-the-webknossos-ui-more-intuitive-81dd364ad70e). The most important changes are:
  - The toolbar now contains dedicated tools for moving, editing skeletons and erasing volume data.
  - Right click opens a context menu for all tools, unless "Classic Mode" is enabled in the Settings tab (left sidebar).
  - The two tabs in the left sidebar "Annotation" and "Dataset" were renamed and restructured to "Layers" and "Settings". Some elements were also moved to other areas, such as the toolbar (e.g., the merger mode) or to dedicated tabs in the right sidebar (e.g., bounding boxes).
  - The status bar contains additional elements for (editable) information, such as the active tree id (previously positioned in the left sidebar).
- Added compatibility with newer JREs, tested with 8, 11 and 14. [#5558](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5558)

### Added
- Added the possibility for admins to set long-running jobs to a “manually repaired” state. [#5530](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5530)
- The toolbar contains two  additional tools: [#5384](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5384)
  - one for the skeleton mode (similar to the existing move tool).
  - one for erasing volume data (similar to right-dragging with the previous brush/trace tool)
- Added colored icons to the status entries in the job list. [#5572](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5594)
- Back-end side analytics are now sent to events-relay.webknossos.org by default. You can opt out by setting `backendAnalytics.uri` to empty in your config. [5607](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5607)

### Changed
- Improve error logging for unhandled rejections. [#5575](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5575)
- Improved dragging behavior of trees/groups in the tree tab. [#5573](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5573)
- "Center new Nodes" option was renamed to "Auto-center Nodes" and changed to also influence the centering-behavior when deleting a node. [#5538](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5538)
- The displayed webKnossos version now omits the parent release name for intermediate builds. [#5565](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5565)
- The following changes belong to [#5384](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5384):
  - The move tool is only capable of performing movements (its skeleton-functionalities were moved to a dedicated skeleton tool).
  - (Unless classic mode is enabled:) Right-click opens a context-sensitive menu by default with various actions, such as creating an edge between two nodes. Consequently, important actions which were done via right click previously were changed:
      - In the skeleton tool, left click can be used to create, select and move nodes. Also, mere dragging (without hovering a node) moves the active position (similar to the move tool).
      - In the trace/brush tool, erasure cannot be performed with right click, anymore. Instead, CTRL + Shift + Left Click works for erasing. Alternatively, selecting the dedicated erase tool also works.
  - The two tabs in the left sidebar "Annotation" and "Dataset" were renamed and restructured to "Layers" and "Settings".
      - "Layers" contains the layers which were previously visible in "Dataset".
    - Also, "Layers" contains a dedicated Skeleton layer which handles skeleton-specific settings (e.g., clipping distance).
    - "Merger Mode" and "Soma Clicking" were moved to the toolbar (visible when the skeleton tool is selected).
    - “Brush Size” was moved to the toolbar (visible when brush or brush-eraser is selected)
    - "Controls" and "Viewport options" (previously under "Annotation") and "Data Rendering" (previously under "Dataset") were moved to "Settings".
    - The "Bounding Boxes" section in "Annotation" tab was moved to an own tab to the right sidebar.
    - The "Mapping" setting was moved to the segmentation layer in the left sidebar.
  - The status bar contains additional elements for (editable) information, such as the active tree id (previously positioned in the left sidebar).
  - In some UI elements, text was replaced by icons. An explaining tooltip can be shown by hovering.
- The health check at api/health does not longer include checking data/health and tracings/health if the respective local modules are enabled. Consider monitoring those routes separately. [#5601](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5601)
- Improved the progress display for dataset uploads. [5616](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5616)

### Fixed
- Fixed that a disabled "Center new Nodes" option didn't work correctly in merger mode. [#5538](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5538)
- Fixed a bug where dataset uploads of zips with just one file inside failed. [#5534](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5534)
- Fixed a benign error message when a dataset without a segmentation layer was opened in view mode or with a skeleton-only annotation. [#5583](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5583)
- Fixed crashing tree tab which could happen when dragging a node and then switching directly to another tab (e.g., comments) and then back again. [#5573](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5573)
- Fixed a bug that the selection of nodes in the skeleton tool was possible for nodes far behind the position and thus prevented creating new nodes. [#5624](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5624)
- Fixed that the UI allowed mutating trees in the tree tab (dragging/creating/deleting trees and groups) in read-only tracings. [#5573](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5573)
- Fixed "Create a new tree group for this file" setting in front-end import when a group id of 0 was used in the NML. [#5573](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5573)
- Fixed a bug that caused a distortion when moving or zooming in the maximized 3d viewport. [#5550](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5550)
- Fixed a bug that prevented focusing the login fields when being prompted to login after trying to view a dataset without being logged in.[#5521](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5577)
- Fixed a bug that prevented the modal to export data of a bounding box to tiff files to open up. [#5624](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5624)
- Fixed that the 3d view content disappeared permanently if the 3d view was resized to not be visible. [#5588](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5588)
- Fixed a bug where nested tree groups were messed up during NML upload if “Create a new tree group for this file.“ is selected. [#5596](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5596)

### Removed
- The following changes belong to [#5384](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5384):
  - Removed "Highlight hovered cells" setting (highlight on hover will always be done).
  - The "Volume" tab was removed. The "Mapping" setting was moved to the segmentation layer in the left sidebar. The "segment id" table was removed, as the status bar also contains the information about the hovered cell id.

- WKW Dataset uploads with missing mag or layer dir no longer fail, instead the paths are automatically added (defaults to color/1). [#5285](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5285)

### Changed
- Measured distances will be shown in voxel space, too. [#5240](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5240)
- Improved documentation and inline-help for data import and conversion. [#5420](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5420)

- Fixed a bug where uploading NMLs from dashboard via file picker was inaccessible. [#5308](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5308)

### Breaking Change
- The front-end API methods `measurePathLengthBetweenNodes`, `measureAllTrees` and `measureTreeLength` were changed to return a tuple containing the distance in nm and in vx (instead of only returning the distance in nm). [#5240](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5240)

## [21.03.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/21.03.1) - 2021-02-24
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/21.03.0...21.03.1)

### Highlights
- The "Meshes" tab was overhauled, so that it displays generated isosurfaces and imported meshes. Generated isosurfaces can be jumped to, reloaded, downloaded and removed. [#4917](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4917)
- Before uploading a dataset webKnossos automatically checks whether a conversion and scale are needed. Additionally, the Upload UI was improved. [#5081](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/issues/5081)
- Support for KNOSSOS cubes data format was removed. Use the [webKnossos cuber](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos-cuber) tool to convert existing datasets saved as KNOSSOS cubes. [#5085](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5085)

### Added
- Added an explicit `/signup` (or `/auth/signup`) route. [#5091](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5091)

- For webKnossos maintenance, superUsers can now join organizations without being listed as a user there. [#5151](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5151)
- Added the possibility to track events for analytics in the backend. [#5156](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5156)

### Changed
- Changed the font to [Titillium Web](http://nta.accademiadiurbino.it/titillium/). [#5161](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5161)
- Made the isosurface feature in the meshes tab more robust. If a request fails, a retry is initiated. [#5102](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5102)
- Support for the old invite links was removed. These contained the organization name in the URL. The new links contain a token (can be generated in the users view). For instances with a single organization the old invite links should still work. [#5091](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5091)
- Users are no longer allowed to deactivate their own accounts.  [#5070](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5070)
- Users are asked to confirm when leaving the dataset upload view while an upload is still running. [#5051](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5049)
- Mailer now uses only TLS1.2 instead of JDK default. [#5138](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5138)
- Make keyboard-driven movement through the dataset better aligned with the configured move value in certain scenarios. [#5201](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5201)
- User experience domains are now separated by organization. [#5149](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5149)
- Changed the default request timeouts for standalone datastores and tracingstores to match those of local ones (10000s instead of 75s). [#5174](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5174)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where the user could delete teams that were still referenced in annotations, projects or task types, thus creating invalid state. [#5108](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5108)
- Fixed a bug where an error occurred when clicking on the hours/week graph in the statistics overview page. [#4779](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5113)
- Fixed a bug where the listing of users that have open tasks of a project failed. [#5115](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5115)
- Fixed a bug that task scripts weren't correctly re-initialized when a new task was requested. This happened when certain conditions were met. [#5199](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/issues/5199)
- Fixed some scenarios where the Meshes tab could cause errors (e.g., when the UI was used but no segmentation layer was available). [#5142](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5142)
- Fixed a bug where the user (and telemetry) would get a cryptic error message when trying to register with an email that is already in use. [#5152](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5152)
- Fixed a bug where default dataset configuration could not be loaded if a dataset was accessed via sharing token [#5164](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5164)
- Fixed a bug where viewing a volume task as compound annotation failed for tasks with single instances. [#5198](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5198)

### Removed
- The isosurface setting was removed. Instead, isosurfaces can be generated via the "Meshes" tab. Also note that the Shift+Click binding for generating an isosurface was removed (for now). Please refer to the "Meshes" tab, too. [#4917](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4917)

## [21.02.1](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/21.02.1) - 2021-02-03
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/21.02.0...21.02.1)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where the listing of users that have open tasks of a project failed. [#5115](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5115)
- Fixed shift+clicking isosurfaces in annotations which contain skeletons. [#5257](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5257)

## [21.02.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/21.02.0) - 2021-01-20
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/21.01.0...21.02.0)

### Highlights
- The dataset import UI was streamlined by making it clearer when automatic suggestions are available for the dataset properties. Previously, these suggestions were applied automatically which could cause some confusion. [#4944](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4944)
- Added the possibility to generate skeletons from an HDF5 agglomerate file mapping on-the-fly. With an activated agglomerate file mapping, use `Shift + Middle Mouse Click` to import a skeleton of the cell into the annotation. Alternatively, use the button in the segmentation tab to import a skeleton of the centered cell into the annotation. [#4958](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4958)

### Added
- Added a context menu via *Shift & Right Click* that provides easy access to skeleton functionalities and additional information. [#4950](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4950)
- Added a cleanup procedure for erroneous uploads, so failed uploads can be retried without changing the dataset name. [#4999](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4999)

### Changed
- Suggestions for the datasource settings of a dataset are no longer applied automatically. They can be applied optionally now. [#4944](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4944)
- The brush tool is disabled in low magnifications (magnification 16 and lower) to avoid performance problems when annotating. [#5017](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5017)
- The fill tool is disabled in low magnifications (magnification 2 and lower) to avoid producing spotty annotations (caused by needing too much main memory). [#5050](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5050)
- Users can now join multiple organizations, admins can now invite users by email address, skipping the manual user activation step. [#4984](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4984)
- Dataset Manager role now additionally grants permission to create explorative annotations on all datasets. [#5037](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5037)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where importing NMLs failed if they had unescaped greater-than signs inside of attributes. [#5003](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5003)
- Mitigate errors concerning localStorage quotas in the datasets dashboard. [#5039](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5039)
- Fixed a bug where viewing a dataset via sharingToken crashed. [#5047](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5047)

## [21.01.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/21.01.0) - 2020-12-21
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/20.12.0...21.01.0)

### Highlights
- The menu for viewing, editing and creating annotations for a dataset in the dashboard was cleaned up a bit. Creating a hybrid (skeleton + volume) annotation is now the default way of annotating a dataset. The other options are still available via a dropdown. [#4939](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4939)

### Added
- Datasets without any layer are now considered unimported. [#4959](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4959)

### Changed
- For 2d-only datasets the view mode toggle is hidden. [#4952](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4952)
- Persist the selected overwrite behavior for hybrid and volume annotations. [#4962](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4962)
- Backend NML parser now allows NML nodes without radius attribute. Instead, their radius now defaults to a value of 1.0, which is also the new default value for initial nodes. Note that the node radius is only relevant when default setting “overwrite node radius” is disabled. [#4982](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4982)

### Fixed
- Fix crash for trees with high comment count (> 100000 nodes). [#4965](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4965)
- Fix the upload of single file datasets. [#4977](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4977)

## [20.12.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/20.12.0) - 2020-11-23
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/20.11.0...20.12.0)

### Highlights
- Added multi-resolution volume annotations. As a result, volume tracings can be viewed even when zooming out to downsampled magnifications. Note that already existing volume tracings will still only contain data in the first magnification. If you want to migrate an old volume tracing, you can explicitly trigger the downsampling in the sidebar's layer settings. [#4755](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4755)
- Improved performance of volume annotations (brush and trace tool). [#4848](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4848)

### Added
- The total length of skeletons can now be measured using the dropdown in the tree list tab. Also, the frontend API received the methods `api.tracing.measureTreeLength` and `api.tracing.measureAllTrees`. [#4898](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4898)
- Introduced an indeterminate visibility state for groups in the tree tab if not all but only some of the group's children are visible. Before, the visibility of those groups was shown as not visible which made it hard to find the visible trees. [#4897](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4897)
- Dataset uploads on a specific Datastore can now be restricted to a single organization. [#4892](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4892)
- Added a button to set the color of a tree in the trees tab view. [#4907](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4907)

### Changed
- In the tree tab, all groups but the root group are now collapsed instead of expanded when opening a tracing. [#4897](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4897)
- New volume/hybrid annotations are now automatically multi-resolution volume annotations. [#4755](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4755)
- Re-enabled continuous brush strokes. This feature ensures that even fast brush strokes are continuous and don't have "holes". [#4924](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4924)
- The Historgram now has a correct linear scale. [#4926](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4926)

### Fixed
- Fixed the disappearing of dataset settings after switching between view mode and annotation mode. [#4845](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4845)
- Fixed a rare error in the agglomerate mapping for large datasets. [#4904](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4904)
- Fixed a bug where in volume annotation zip upload some buckets were discarded. [#4914](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4914)
- Fixed the Dataset import which was broken temporarily. [#4932](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4932)
- Fixed the upload of multiple volume annotations with similar data zip names. [#4915](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4915)

## [20.11.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/20.11.0) - 2020-10-26
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/20.10.0...20.11.0)

### Highlights
- Improved the toolbar to make the different webKnossos tools easier to use. For example, the fill-tool and the cell-picker have a dedicated button in volume annotations now. [#4875](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4875)
- The dataset upload is now more robust and can recover from a failed upload of a data chunk. [#4860](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4860)
- Movements in the 3D viewport are now time-tracked. [#4876](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4876)

### Added
- Hybrid tracings can now be imported directly in the tracing view via drag'n'drop. [#4837](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4837)
- The find data function now works for volume tracings, too. [#4847](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4847)
- Added admins and dataset managers to dataset access list, as they can access all datasets of the organization. [#4862](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4862)
- Added the possibility to move the current position by dragging with the middle-mouse-button (regardless of the active tool). [#4875](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4875)
- Sped up the NML parsing via dashboard import. [#4872](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4872)

### Changed
- Brush circles are now connected with rectangles to provide a continuous stroke even if the brush is moved quickly. [#4785](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4822)
- The position input of tracings now accepts decimal input. When losing focus the values are cut off at the comma. [#4803](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4803)
- webknossos.org only: Accounts associated with new organizations can now be created even when a datastore is unreachable. The necessary folders are created lazily when needed. [#4846](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4846)
- When downloading a volume tracing, buckets containing a single 0 byte, that were created to restore older versions, are now skipped. [#4851](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4851)
- Task information CSV now contains additional column `creationInfo`, containing the original NML filename for tasks based on existing NMLs. [#4866](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4866)
- The default overwrite-behavior in volume annotating changed so that erasing with the brush- or trace-tool always erases all voxels (regardless of their segment id). Before that, only the current segment id was overwritten by default. As before, this behavior can be toggled by pressing CTRL. Alternatively, one can now also switch the mode in the toolbar. [#4875](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4875)

### Fixed
- Fixed failing histogram requests for float layers with NaN values. [#4834](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4834)

## [20.10.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/20.10.0) - 2020-9-21
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/20.09.0...20.10.0)

### Highlights
- Added the possibility to undo and redo volume annotation strokes. [#4771](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4771)
- Isosurface generation now also supports volume tracings (without fallback layers). [#4567](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4567)
- Added a tool to initiate a flood fill in a volume tracing with the active cell id. [#4780](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4780)
- Added the possibility to navigate to the preceding/subsequent node by pressing "ctrl + ," or "ctrl + ." in a skeleton tracing. [#4147](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4784)

### Added
- Added the possibility to merge volume tracings both via file upload (zip of zips) and when viewing projects/tasks as compound annotations. [#4709](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4709)
- Added the possibility to remove the fallback segmentation layer from a hybrid/volume tracing. Accessible by a minus button next to the layer's settings. [#4741](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4766)

### Changed
- When d/f switching is turned off and a slice is copied with the shortcut `v`, the previous slice used as the source will always be slice - 1 and `shift + v` will always take slice + 1 as the slice to copy from. [#4728](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4728)
- Disabled the autofill feature of the brush when using this tool to erase data. [#4729](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4729)
- The rotation buttons of the 3D-viewport no longer change the zoom. [#4750](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4750)

## [20.09.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/20.9.0) - 2020-8-20
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/20.8.0...20.09.0)

### Highlights
- Improved the distinguishability of segments by improving the color generation and also by rendering patterns within the segments. The pattern opacity can be adapted in the layer settings (next to the opacity of the segmentation layer). [#4730](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4730)
- Added the possibility to move nodes in skeleton tracings. This can be done either by pressing CTRL + arrow key or by dragging while holding CTRL. [#4743](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4743)

### Added
- Added the possibility to delete datasets on disk from webKnossos. Use with care. [#4696](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4696)
- Added error toasts for failing bucket requests. [#4740](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4740)
- Added a list of all projects containing tasks of a specific task type. It's accessible from the task types list view. [#4420](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4745)

### Changed
- When d/f switching is turned off and a slice is copied with the shortcut `v`, the previous slice used as the source will always be slice - 1 and `shift + v` will always take slice + 1 as the slice to copy from. [#4728](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4728)
- Disabled the autofill feature of the brush when using this tool to erase data. [#4729](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4729)
- The rotation buttons of the 3D-viewport no longer change the zoom. [#4750](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4750)
- Improved the performance of applying agglomerate files. [#4706](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4706)
- In the Edit/Import Dataset form, the "Sharing" tab was renamed to "Sharing & Permissions". Also, existing permission-related settings were moved to that tab.  [#4683](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4763)
- Improved rotation of camera in 3D viewport. [#4768](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4768)

- The volume annotation tools in hybrid tracings are disabled while in merger mode. [#4757](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4770)
- The title of a tab now shows the active tracing or dataset as well as the corresponding organization. [#4653](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4767)
- When viewing or tracing a dataset with only one slice (2D data) the default layout displays only the XY plane. The other viewports can still be accessed by changing the viewport tab. [#4738](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4778)

### Fixed
- Speed up NML import in existing tracings for NMLs with many trees (20,000+). [#4742](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4742)
- Fixed tree groups when uploading NMLs with multi-component trees. [#4735](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4735)

[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/20.07.0...20.08.0)

### Highlights
- Added the possibility to have multiple user-defined bounding boxes in an annotation. Task bounding boxes are automatically converted to such user bounding boxes upon “copy to my account” / reupload as explorational annotation. [#4536](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4536)
- Separated the permissions of Team Managers (now actually team-scoped) and Dataset Managers (who can see all datasets). The database evolution makes all Team Managers also Dataset Managers, so no workflows should be interrupted. New users may have to be made Dataset Managers, though. For more information, refer to the updated documentation. [#4663](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4663)
- Backend NML parser no longer rejects NMLs with trees that have multiple connected components. Instead, it splits those into one separate tree per component. [#4688](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4688)

### Added

- Added the possibility to adjust the minimum and maximum value of the histogram for a layer. This option can be opened in the top right corner of the histogram. [#4630](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4630)
- Added a warning to the segmentation tab when viewing `uint64` bit segmentation data. [#4598](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4598)
- Added the possibility to have multiple user-defined bounding boxes in an annotation. Task bounding boxes are automatically converted to such user bounding boxes upon “copy to my account” / reupload as explorational annotation. [#4536](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4536)
- Added additional information to each task in CSV download. [#4647](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4647)

- Added a warning during task creation if task dataset cannot be accessed by project team members. [#4695](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4695)
- Included the server time in error messages, making debugging misbehavior easier. [#4707](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4707)

### Changed
- Separated the permissions of Team Managers (now actually team-scoped) and Dataset Managers (who can see all datasets). The database evolution makes all Team Managers also Dataset Managers, so no workflows should be interrupted. New users may have to be made Dataset Managers, though. For more information, refer to the updated documentation. [#4663](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4663)
- Refined all webKnossos emails for user signups etc. Switched emails to use HTML templates for more bling bling. [#4676](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4676)
- Backend NML parser no longer rejects NMLs with trees that have multiple connected components. Instead, it splits those into one separate tree per component. [#4688](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4688)

### Fixed
- Fixed that merger mode didn't work with undo and redo. Also fixed that the mapping was not disabled when disabling merger mode. [#4669](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4669)
- Fixed a bug where webKnossos relied upon but did not enforce organization names to be unique. [#4685](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4685)
- Fixed that being outside of a bounding box could be rendered as if one was inside the bounding box in some cases. [#4690](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4690)
- Fixed a bug where admins could revoke their own admin rights even if they are the only admin in their organization, leading to an invalid state. [#4698](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4698)
- Fixed a bug where webKnossos ignored existing layer category information from datasource-properties.json when exploring layers on disk. [#4694](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4694)

### Removed

- Removed the “are you sure” warning when editing datasets with no allowed teams. Instead, a warning during task creation is shown in this case. [#4695](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4695)

- Added a shortcut (Q) and button to screenshot the tracing views. [#3834](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3834)
- Rendered isosurfaces in the 3D viewport can now be interacted with. Shift+Click on an isosurface will jump exactly to where you clicked. Also, hovering over an isosurface will highlight that cell in all viewports. [#3858](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3858)
- Neuroglancer precomputed datasets can now be added to webKnossos using the webknossos-connect service. [#3843](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3843)

Also the data viewing and tracing workflow is smoothed further:
- Different loading strategies are now supported ("best quality first" and "progressive quality"). Additionally, the rendering can use different magnifications as a fallback. [#3801](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3801)
- Performance improvements :racing_car: [#3880](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3880) & [#3902](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3902)

- Added a shortcut (Q) and button in the actions dropdown to screenshot the tracing views. The screenshots will contain everything that is visible in the tracing views, so feel free to disable the crosshairs in the settings or toggle the tree visibility using the (1) and (2) shortcuts before triggering the screenshot. [#3834](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3834)
- Neuroglancer precomputed datasets can now be added to webKnossos using the webknossos-connect (wk-connect) service. To setup a wk-connect datastore follow the instructions in the [Readme](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos-connect). Afterwards, datasets can be added through "Add Dataset" - "Add Dataset via wk-connect". [#3843](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3843)

- Improved the flight mode performance for tracings with very large trees (>80.000 nodes). [#3880](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3880)
- Tweaked the highlighting of the active node. The inner node looks exactly as a non-active node and is not round, anymore. An active node is circled by a "halo". In arbitrary mode, the halo is hidden and the active node is round. [#3868](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3868)
- Improved the performance of moving through a dataset which should make the overall interaction smoother. [#3902](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3902)
- Brush size is independent of zoom value, now. This change simplifies volume annotations, as brush sizes can be adapted to certain structures (e.g., vesicles) and don't need to be changed when zooming. [#3868](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3889)
- Reworked the search in the trees tab. [#3878](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3878)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where failed large save requests lead to inconsistent tracings on the server. [#3829](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3829)
- Fixed the setting which enables to hide the planes within the 3D viewport. [#3857](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3857)
- Fixed a bug which allowed the brush size to become negative when using shortcuts. [#3861](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3861)
- Fixed interpolation along z-axis. [#3888](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3888)
- Fixed that the halo of the active node could cover other nodes. [#3919](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3919)
- Fixed that the 3D viewport was partially occluded due to clipping distance issues. [#3919](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3919)
- Fixed that scrolling with the mouse wheel over a data viewport also scrolled the page. This bug appeared with the new Chrome version 73. [#3939](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3939)

### Removed
- Removed FPS meter in Annotation View. [#3916](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3916)


## [19.03.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/19.03.0) - 2019-03-04
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/19.02.0...19.03.0)

### Highlights
- The tracing view got two major improvements:
   - Data rendering is now fully using the available space and doesn't have to be quadratic anymore. Increasing the size of a viewport will result in more data being rendered (as opposed to the same data will be upscaled). [#3634](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3634)
   - The active node is highlighted with a "halo ring". Additionally, the node is also rendered as a circle. In flight and oblique modes the halo is hidden. [#3731](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3731)
- Added the possibility to create volume annotation tasks. When creating a task type, select whether to create `volume` or `skeleton` tasks. Compound viewing and file upload for volume tasks is not yet supported. [#3712](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3712)
- Mappings for segmentations will be read automatically from the file system. It's not necessary to define the mappings within the `datasource-properties.json` anymore. [#3720](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3720)

### Added
- Added the possibility to create volume annotation tasks. When creating a task type, select whether to create `volume` or `skeleton` tasks. Note that compound viewing for volume tasks is not supported yet. Same for creating volume tasks from uploaded nml/data files. [#3712](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3712)
- Added an UI to select a mapping for a segmentation layer. The UI is placed in the segmentation tab within the tracing view. [#3720](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3720)
- Added a button to jump to actual data if the bounding box of a dataset contains a lot of black data. [#3682](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3682)

### Changed
- Data rendering is not tied to square viewports, anymore. As a result the screen space is used more efficiently to show data. Also, increasing the size of a viewport will result in more data being rendered (as opposed to the same data will be upscaled). [#3634](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3634)
- Mappings for segmentations will be read automatically from the file system. It's not necessary to define the mappings within the `datasource-properties.json`, anymore. [#3720](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3720)
- The active node is highlighted with a "halo ring". Additionally, the node is also rendered as a circle. In flight and oblique modes the halo is hidden. [#3731](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3731)
- In the dashboard list of active tasks, the project name is now featured more prominently, as it switched places with the task type summary. [#3792](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3792)
- Isosurfaces are now loaded from the middle outwards. [#3818](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3818)
- The brush size will now be remembered across page reloads. [#3827](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3827)
- Do not show publication view if no publications are specified. [#3778](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3778)

### Fixed
- Fixed an error that occured when changing the URL hash. [#3746](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3746)
- Fixed a bug in the timeline chart rendering. The start and end time of the timeline chart now match the selected time range. [#3772](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3772)
- The modals for a new task description and recommended task settings are no longer shown in read-only tracings. [#3724](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3724)
- Fixed a rendering bug when opening a task that only allowed flight/oblique mode tracing. [#3783](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3783)
- Fixed a bug where some NMLs caused the webKnossos tab to freeze during NML upload. [#3758](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3758)
- Fixed a bug where some skeleton save requests were wrongly rejected if they were sent more than once. [#3767](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3767)
- Fixed a bug which caused a wrong aspect ratio in the 3D viewport when changing the layout. [#3817](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3817)

## [18.09.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/18.09.0) - 2018-08-20

[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/18.08.0...18.09.0)

### Highlights

- The dashboard gallery loads faster [#3036](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3036) and tracings in the dashboard can show their descriptions [#3035](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3035).
- Managing new users got easier through "new inactive users" notifications [#2994](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2994), and also team managers can activate them now [#3050](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3050).
- Improved the UI for sharing datasets and tracings [#3029](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3029).
- The tracing view got a progress-indicator [#2935](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2935) and scale-bars [#3049](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3049).
- When merging datasets within a tracing via the merge-modal, the user can choose whether the merge should be executed directly in the currently opened tracing. Alternatively, a new annotation can be created which is accessible via the dashboard, as before [#2935](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2935).

### Added

- Added two new properties to mapping json files. The `colors: [<hsvHueValue1>, <hsvHueValue2>, ...]` property can be used to specify up to 256 custom colors for the first 256 equivalence classes of the mapping. The `hideUnmappedIds: <true|false>` property indicates whether segments that were not mapped should be rendered transparently or not. [#2965](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2965)
- Added a button for refreshing the dataset in the backend cache. [#2975](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2975)
- Added the possibility to see the description of a tracing within the dashboard. [#3035](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3035)
- Comments of tracing trees can now be cycled through by keeping n and p pressed. [#3041](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3041)
- All dates in webknossos will be shown in the browser's timezone. On hover, a tooltip will show the date in UTC. [#2916](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2916) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2486553/42888385-74c82bc0-8aa8-11e8-9c3e-7cfc90ce93bc.png)
- When merging datasets within a tracing via the merge-modal, the user can choose whether the merge should be executed directly in the currently opened tracing. Alternatively, a new annotation can be created which is accessible via the dashboard (as it has been before).
- Added shortcuts for moving along the current tracing direction in orthogonal mode. Pressing 'e' (and 'r' for the reverse direction) will move along the "current direction", which is defined by the vector between the last two created nodes.
- Added a banner to the user list to notify admins of new inactive users that need to be activated. [#2994](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2994)
- When a lot of changes need to be persisted to the server (e.g., after importing a large NML), the save button will show a percentage-based progress indicator.
- Changing tabs in a tracing view will not disable the keyboard shortcuts anymore. [#3042](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3042)
- Added the possibility for admins to see and transfer all active tasks of a project to a single user in the project tab[#2863](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2863)
- Added the possibility to import multiple NML files into the active tracing. This can be done by dragging and dropping the files directly into the tracing view. [#2908](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2908)
- Added placeholders and functionality hints to (nearly) empty lists and tables in the admin views. [#2969](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2969)
- Added the possibility to copy volume tracings to own account
- During the import of multiple NML files, the user can select an option to automatically create a group per file so that the imported trees are organized in a hierarchy. [#2908](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2908)
- Added the option to display scale bars in the viewports for orthogonal mode. [#3049](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3049)
- Added functions to the front-end API to activate a tree and to change the color of a tree. [#2997](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2997)
- When a new team or project is created, invalid names will be directly marked in red. [#3034](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3034)
- Added an error message to the NML upload if the needed permissions are missing for the upload. [#3051](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3051)
- Comments can now contain references to nodes (`#<nodeid>`) or positions (`#(<x,y,z>)`). Clicking on such a reference activates the respective node or position and centers it. [#2950](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2950)
- Added a default text to the task view to indicate, that no users are assigned to a task. [#3030](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/issues/3030)

### Changed

- Added a checkbox to disable the warning when deleting a tree. An accidentally deleted tree can easily be restored using the Undo functionality. [#2995](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2995)
- Improved the UI for sharing datasets and tracings. [#3029](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3029)
- Team managers are now allowed to activate users (previously admin-only) [#3050](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3050)
- Improved the loading time of datasets in the dashboard. [#3036](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3036)

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where unloaded data was sometimes shown as black instead of gray. [#2963](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2963)
- Fixed that URLs linking to a certain position in a dataset or tracing always led to the position of the active node. [#2960](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2960)
- Fixed that setting a bounding box in view mode did not work. [#3015](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3015)
- Fixed a bug where viewing Compound Annotations (such as viewing all instances of a task at once) failed with a permission issue. [#3023](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3023)
- Fixed that the segmentation layer is loaded from the server even when the segmentation opacity is set to 0. [#3067](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3067)
- Fixed a bug where the team name was not displayed in the task types view of admins. [#3053](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/3053)

## [18.08.0](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/releases/tag/18.08.0) - 2018-07-23

[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/18.07.0...18.08.0)

### Highlights

- Performance improvements for the tracing views. #2709 #2724 #2821
- Added onboarding flow for initial setup of WebKnossos. #2859
- The dataset gallery got a redesign with mobile support. #2761
- Improved the import dialog for datasets. Important fields can now be edited via form inputs instead of having to change the JSON. The JSON is still changeable when enabling an "Advanced" mode. #2881
- Added possibility to share a special link to invite users to join your organization. Following that link, the sign-up form will automatically register the user for the correct organization. #2898

### Added

- Added release version to navbar [#2888](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2888)
- Users can view datasets in a table from the dashboard. That view also allows to create explorational tracings (which had to be done via the gallery view for non-admins before). [#2866](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2866)
- Added the task bounding box of a skeleton tracing to NML files. [#2827](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2827) \
   Example: `<taskBoundingBox topLeftX="0" topLeftY="0" topLeftZ="0" width="512" height="512" depth="512" />`
- Added the possibility to kick a user out of the organization team. [#2801](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2801)
- Added a mandatory waiting interval of 10 seconds when getting a task with a new task type. The modal containing the task description cannot be closed earlier. These ten seconds should be used to fully understand the new task type. [#2793](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2793)
- Added possibility to share a special link to invite users to join your organization. Following that link, the sign-up form will automatically register the user for the correct organization. [#2898](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2898)
- Added more debugging related information in case of unexpected errors. The additional information can be used when reporting the error. [#2766](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2766)
- Added permission for team managers to create explorational tracings on datasets without allowed teams. [#2758](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2758)
- Added higher-resolution images for dataset gallery thumbnails. [#2745](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2745)
- Added permission for admins to get tasks from all projects in their organization. [#2728](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2728)
- Added the shortcut to copy the currently hovered cell id (CTRL + I) to non-volume-tracings, too. [#2726](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2726)
- Added permission for team managers to refresh datasets. [#2688](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2688)
- Added backend-unit-test setup and a first test for NML validation. [#2829](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2829)
- Added progress indicators to the save button for cases where the saving takes some time (e.g., when importing a large NML). [#2947](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2947)
- Added the possibility to not sort comments by name. When clicking the sort button multiple times, sorting is switched to sort by IDs. [#2915](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2915)
- Added displayName for organizations. [#2869](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2869)
- Added onboarding flow for initial setup of WebKnossos. [#2859](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2859)
- Added the possibility to show the task in a random order. [#2860](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2860)

### Changed

- Improved the search functionality in the datasets view. The datasets will be sorted so that the best match is shown first. If a different sorting is desired, the sorting-arrows in the columns can still be used to change the sorting criteria. [#2834](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2834)
- Improved performance in orthogonal mode. [#2821](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2821)
- When deleting the last node of a tree, that tree will not be removed automatically anymore. Instead, the tree will just be empty. To remove that active tree, the "delete" shortcut can be used again. [#2806](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2806)
- Renamed "Cancel" to "Reset and Cancel" for tasks. [#2910](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2910)
- Changed the type of the initial node of new tasks to be a branchpoint (if not created via NML). [#2799](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2799)
- The dataset gallery got a redesign with mobile support. [#2761](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2761)

- Improved loading speed of buckets. [#2724](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2724)
- Changed the task search, when filtered by user, to show all instead of just active tasks (except for canceled tasks). [#2774](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2774)
- Improved the import dialog for datasets. Important fields can now be edited via form inputs instead of having to change the JSON. The JSON is still changeable when enabling an "Advanced" mode. [#2881](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2881)
- Hid old paused projects in the project progress report even if they have open instances. [#2768](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2768)
- Excluded canceled tasks and base tracings from the list at `api/projects/:name/usersWithOpenTasks`. [#2765](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2765)
- Streamlined the order in which initial buckets are loaded when viewing a dataset. [#2749](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2749)
- Reduced the number of scenarios in which segmentation-related warnings are shown (e.g, not for skeleton tracings when there are multiple resolutions for segmentations anyway). [#2715](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2715)
- Email addresses for notifications about new users and about task overtime are no longer specified instance-wide but once per organization. [#2939](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2939)
- Improved tracing view page load performance by decreasing WebGL shader compilation time. [#2709](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2709)

- Redesigned the user task list to make it easier to read the whole task description. [#2861](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2861)

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug which caused segmentation data to be requested as four-bit when four-bit-mode was enabled. [#2828](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2828)
- Fixed a bug where possible comments or branchpoints sometimes were not properly deleted when deleting a node. [2897](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2897)
- Fixed a bug which caused projects to be unpaused when the project priority was changed. [#2795](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2795)
- Fixed an unnecessary warning when deleting a tree in a task, that warned about deleting the initial node although the initial node was not contained in the deleted tree. [#2812](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2812)
- Fixed a bug where the comment tab was scrolled into view horizontally if a node with a comment was activated. [#2805](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2805)
- Fixed a bug in for Firefox users where a long tree list created an unnecessary scroll region. [#2787](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2787)
- Fixed clicking on a task type within the task list page, so that the task type page will actually only show the linked task type. [#2769](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2769)
- Fixed clicking on a project within the task list page, so that the project page will actually only show the linked project. [#2759](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2759)
- Fixed a bug in the front-end API's `setMapping` call which caused ignored calls if the provided object was mutated. [#2921](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2921)
- Fixed a bug where cell IDs in the segmentation tab were not shown for all zoomsteps. [#2726](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2726)
- Fixed the naming of the initial tree in tasks. [#2689](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2689)
- Fixed a regression affecting node selection, shortcuts and 3d viewport navigation. [#2673](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2673)
- Fixed the dataset zip upload for datasets, which only have one data layer and no config file. [#2840](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2840)
- Fixed a bug where task deletion broke the task listing for users who had active annotations for the task [#2884](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2884)
- Fixed that decimal scales (e.g., 11.24, 11.24, 30) couldn't be defined for datasets in "simple" mode. [#2912](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/2912)
