# Teams
Teams can be used to organize an organization's users into groups. Teams are useful for managing dataset access permissions, task/project management, or simply for organizing users into logical groups.

When creating your organization, a default team is created for you.
All new organization members are assigned to that team by default.

An organization can contain as many teams as you like. Users can be assigned to multiple teams.
