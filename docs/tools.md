# Tools

You can use these tools in the WEBKNOSSOS toolbar to work with skeletons:

- `Move`: Navigate around the dataset.
- `Skeleton`: Create skeleton annotations and place nodes with a left mouse click. Read more below.

When the `Skeleton` tool is active, the following modifiers become available:

- `Create new Tree`: Creates a new tree.
- `Toggle single node tree mode`: This modifier makes the skeleton annotation tool create a new tree for each node instead of adding nodes to the current tree. You can use this mode to mark single objects or seeds, such as nuclei. This is also known as "Soma-clicking mode".
- `Toggle merger mode`: This modifier activates the `Merger Mode` for the skeleton annotation tool. In merger mode, you can use skeletons to "collect" and merge volume segments from an over-segmentation. [Read more about `Merger Mode`](./volume_annotation.md#proof_reading_and_merging_segments).
