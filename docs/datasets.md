# Managing Datasets

Working with 3D (and 2D) image datasets is at the heart of WEBKNOSSOS. 

- [Import datasets](#importing-datasets) by uploading them directly via the web UI, streaming them from a remote server/the cloud, or by using the file system.
- [Configure the dataset](#configuring-datasets) defaults and permissions to your specification.
- [Share your datasets](./sharing.md#dataset-sharing) with the public or with selected users.

[Read the section on file and data formats](./data_formats.md) if you are interested in the technical background and concepts behind WEBKNOSSOS datasets.
