While WEBKNOSSOS is great for manual annotation, some datasets are either too big to do by hand or you need results quicker. WEBKNOSSOS contains early access to automated analysis using machine learning classifiers for dataset segmentations. The WEBKNOSSOS developer team has many years of experience with training AI models for large-scale data analysis outside of WEBKNOSSOS. We aim to bring some of this know-how directly into WEBKNOSSOS itself.

The automated analysis features are designed to provide a general solution to a wide range of (EM) datasets. Since datasets differ in staining protocols, imaging modalities, imaging resolution & fidelity, your results may vary. [Please contact us](mailto:hello@webknossos.org) for customized, fine-tuned solutions for your dataset. 

We plan to add more automated analysis features in the future. If you want to work with us on an automated analysis project, [please contact us](mailto:hello@webknossos.org). 
We would love to integrate analysis solutions for more modalities and use cases.

    Automated analysis is only available on [webknossos.org](https://webknossos.org) at the moment. 
    If you want to set up on-premise automated analysis at your institute/workplace, then [please contact sales](mailto:sales@webknossos.org).
