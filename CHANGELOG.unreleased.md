### Added
- Added a credit system making payment for long running jobs possible. For now it is in testing phase. [#8352](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8352)
- The opacity of meshes can be adjusted using the 'Change Segment Color' context menu entry in the segments tab. [#8443](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8443)
- The maximum available storage of an organization is now enforced during upload. [#8385](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8385)
- Performance improvements for volume annotation save requests. [#8460](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8460)
- Performance improvements for segment statistics (volume + bounding box in context menu). [#8469](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8469)
- Upgraded backend dependencies for improved performance and stability. [#8507](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8507)
- New config option `datastore.dataVaults.credentials` allows admins to set up global credentials for remote dataset loading. [#8509](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8509)

### Changed
- Added a parameter to the reserve manual upload route allowing to make the request fail if the name is already taken. Moreover, the new dataset's id and directory name are returned in the response. [#8476](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8476)
- The skeleton tool can no longer be activated if the skeleton layer is invisible. [#8501](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8501)
- Improved speed of mesh rendering and mouse interaction in 3D viewport. [#8106](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8106)

### Fixed
- Fixed visual alignment of actions in ai model list. [#8474](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8474)
- Fixed that is was possible to trigger the find largest segment id job on layers which are not stored as segmentation layers on the server. [#8503](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8503)
- Improve formatting of credits amount in organization management page [#8487](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8487)
- Re-enabled jobs planned to be paid with credits for organizations without a paid plan. [#8478](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8478)
- Fixed that the dataset extent tooltip in the right details bar in the dashboard did not properly update when switching datasets. [#8477](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8477)
- Fixed a bug where task creation with volume zip as input would fail. [#8468](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8468)
- Fixed a rare and subtle bug related to volume annotation and undo/redo. [#7506](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7506)
- Fixed that a warning message about a newer version of an annotation was shown multiple times. [#8486](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8486)
- Fixed a bug where segment statistics would sometimes be wrong in case of an on-disk segmentation fallback layer with segment index file. [#8460](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8460)
- Fixed a bug where sometimes outdated segment statistics would be displayed. [#8460](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8460)
- Fixed a bug where the annotation list would sometimes load very long if you have many annotations. [#8498](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8498)
- Fixed a bug where outbound zarr streaming would contain a typo in the zarr header dimension_separator field. [#8510](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8510)
- Fixed a bug where sometimes large skeletons were not saved correctly, making them inaccessible on the next load. [#8513](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/8513)
