# Proofreading

WEBKNOSSOS offers several ways for proofreading large-scale, volumetric segmentations and reconstruction projects.

There are three proofreading workflows supported by WEBKNOSSOS:

1. The Proofreading tool to correct large segmentations based on an underlying super-voxel graph
2. The Merger-Mode tool
3. Skeleton annotations together with custom scripting
