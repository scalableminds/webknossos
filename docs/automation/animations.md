# Animations

A picture is worth a thousand words. In this spirit, you can use WEBKNOSSOS to create eye-catching animations of your datasets as a video clip. You can use these short movies as part of a presentation, website, for social media or to promote a publication.

## Creating an Animation

Creating an animation is easy:

1. Open any dataset or annotation that you want to use for your animation. 
2. Optionally, load some [3D meshes](../meshes/index.md) for any segments that you wish to highlight.
3. For larger datasets, use the bounding box tool to create a bounding box around your area of interest. Smaller datasets can be used in their entirety.
4. From the `Menu` dropdown in navbar at the top of the screen, select "Create Animation".
5. Configure the animation options as desired, i.e. camera movement or resolution.
6. Click the `Start animation` button to launch the animation creation.


Either periodically check the [background jobs page](./jobs.md) or wait for an email confirmation to download the animation video file. Creating an animation may take a while, depending on the selected bounding box size and the number of included 3D meshes.

WEBKNOSSOS Team plans and above have access to high definition (HD) resolution videos and more options.
