### Added
- In shared annotations with multiple authors, some changes are now stored per user. This means that other users won’t see all those changes if their own diverge. This includes the current position and zoom, visibilities of trees, bounding boxes, and segments (as specified with the checkboxes in the lists), as well as which groups are expanded in the lists. The annotation owner’s user state is used as a fallback for users who haven’t explicitly changed these values themselves.
