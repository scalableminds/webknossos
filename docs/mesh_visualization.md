# Mesh Visualization
webKnossos offers two different methods to render and visualize volumetric segmentations as 3D meshes.

1. Load a pre-computed 3D mesh. Meshes can either be (pre-)computed from within webKnossos for the whole dataset or outside of webKnossos with a `mesh file`. These meshes will be instantly available the next time you open this dataset (quicker mesh loading time).
2. Compute an ad-hoc mesh of any segmentation layer or volume annotation. These meshes will live-computed any time you request them (slower mesh loading time).

Mesh will always be rendered in the 3D viewport in the lower right.

## Loading Meshes
Regardless of the method, meshes can be loaded by right-clicking on any segment and bringing up the context-sensitive action menu. Select `Load Mesh (precomputed)` or `Compute Mesh (ad-hoc)` to load the respective 3D mesh for that segment.

Alternatively, the `Segments` tab in the right-hand side panel, allows you to load the mesh for any segment listed there. Select the corresponding option from the overflow menu next to each list entry.

## Working with Meshes
Any meshes listed in the `Segments` tab can be downloaded as an industry-standard STL file for further rendering/animation, e.g., in Blender ([Read more in this blog series[(https://medium.com/scalableminds/how-to-make-great-videos-for-biomedical-microscopy-data-51218ffa2421)]). Hover over the list entry for the desired mesh to reveal a shortcut menu for downloading, reloading, and unloading/removing meshes.

Mesh visibility can also be triggered from the `Segments` tab.

Shift + Click on any mesh in the 3D viewport will navigate webKnossos to that position.
CTRL + Click on any mesh will unload that mesh.

## Pre-Computed Mesh Generation
Instead of having to slowly compute individual mesh every time you open a dataset, it might make more sense to pre-compute all meshes within a dataset. Pre-computed meshes have the advantage of loading really quickly - even for larger meshes.

You can start the mesh generation from the `Segments` tab in the right-hand side panel. Click on the little plus button to initiate the mesh generation. We recommend computing the meshes in the medium quality (default) to strike a good balance between visual fidelity, compute time, and GPU resource usage.

[Check the `Processing Jobs` page](./jobs.md) from the `Admin` menu at the top of the screen to track progress or cancel the operation. The finished, pre-computed mesh will be available on page reload.
