## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/20.05.0...HEAD)

### Added

- Volume tracing data is now saved with lz4 compression, reducing I/O load and required disk space. [#4602](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4602)

### Changed
- Improved the UI in navigation bar during loading of tracings and datasets. [#4612](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4612)
- Improved logging in case of very slow annotation saving. Additionally, the user is also warned when there are unsaved changes older than two minutes. [#4593](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4593)
- REST API for creating / changing datastores now contains additional field `allowsUpload` denoting if the datastore allows uploading datasets via browser. [#4614](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4614)

### Fixed

- When activating an agglomerate file-based ID mapping, only the segmentation layer will be reloaded from now on. This will improve mapping activation performance. [#4600](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4600)
- Fixed retrying of failed save requests sent during tracingstore restart. [#4591](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/4591)
