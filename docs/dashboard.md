# Dashboard

The Dashboard is the entry point to webKnossos.
In this screen you can manage your datasets, create annotations, resume existing annotations and manage active tasks.

This screen is the main view for all non-admin users.
They can start or continue annotations and work on tasks.
Admins also have access to dedicated administration screens and advanced dataset options.
