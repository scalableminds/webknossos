## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/21.05.1...HEAD)

### Added
- Added the option to hide the plane borders and crosshairs in the 3D viewport. Also, this setting was moved from the "Other" section of the user settings to the 3D viewport. Additionally, added a setting to hide the dataset bounding box in the 3D view. [#5440](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5440)
- Added an icon to the info tab of a tracing that links to the dataset settings. It's located next to the dataset name. [#4772](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5462)
- Added the possibility to load precomputed meshes from a meshfile via the meshes tab or context menu. [#5345](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5345)
- Upgraded several dependencies including Play framework to 2.8, yielding performance and security improvements. [#5515](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5515)

### Changed
- Active nodes and trees are now highlighted with a background color in the comments tab. [#5461](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5461)
- The visibility of meshes can now be toggled via the meshes tab. [#5346](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5345)
- Added an icon to the info tab of a tracing that links to the dataset settings. It's located next to the dataset name. [#5462](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5462)
- When exporting an user bounding box to tiff, the active mapping will now be applied to the exported data, as well. [#5474](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5474)
- Changed the layout of the modal that informs the user about the success of task creations and changed the naming schema for the downloadable csv file containing the information about created tasks. [#5491](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5491)

### Fixed
- Fixed that the row selection in the user table wasn't properly preserved when filtering the table and (un)selecting rows. [#5486](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5486)
- Fixed a bug where histograms generation failed for tiny datasets. [#5458](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5458)
- Fixed a bug where NMLs with huge tree IDs uploaded via back-end produced broken annotations. [#5484](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5484)
- Fixed a bug that led to various possible inconsistencies in the dataset settings in the datasource tab, when the inferred datasource properties suggested by the backend were accepted by the user. [#5492](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5492)
- Fixed a bug where the upload of multiple NMLs failed if some of them have an organization attribute and others donâ€™t. [#5483](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5483)
- Fixed a bug in the application of agglomerate files where the `cumsum.json` was not used correctly. [#5499](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5499)
- Improve loading of precomputed meshes and fix some issues (e.g., deleting a mesh which was still being loaded) which could produce an invalid state. [#5519](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/issues/5519)
- Fixed an innocuous error toast when opening the dataset import view. [#5526](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5526)
- Fixed that creating/editing a volume task type didn't allow submitting the form. [#5532](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5532)

### Removed
- Removed the button to load or refresh the isosurface of the centered cell from the 3D view. Instead, this action can be triggered from the "Meshes" tab. [#5440](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5440)
