# Getting Started

Welcome to the webKnossos documentation.
webKnossos is a tool for [exploring large-scale 3D image datasets](./tracing_ui.md), [creating skeleton annotations](./skeleton_annotation.md) and [3D volume segmentations](./volume_annotation.md).
Since it is a web-based tool, [collaboration](./sharing.md), [crowdsourcing](./tasks.md) and [publication](https://webknossos.org) is very easy.

Feel free to [drop us a line](mailto:hello@scalableminds.com) or [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pulls) if you have any suggestions for improving the documentation.

## Create a webknossos.org Account
Signing up to [webknossos.org](https://webknossos.org) is the easiest way to get started with webKnossos.
Go to [webknossos.org](https://webknossos.org) and create a new account.
Please make sure to enter a correct email address.
After you have entered your details, the account will be automatically activated and logged in.

Accounts on [webknossos.org](https://webknossos.org) are free to use with published datasets.
If you wish to use private datasets, there is an upload limit of 10GB.
For more data storage, checkout the [pricing page for paid plans](https://webknossos.org/pricing) that covers storage costs and provide support services such as dataset conversions.
You can also rent a [fully-managed dedicated webKnossos server](https://webknossos.org/pricing) from scalable minds or install webKnossos [on your own server](./installation.md).


## Explore Published Datasets
On [webknossos.org](https://webknossos.org) there are already a bunch of published community datasets available for you to explore.
To get started, navigate to the `Featured Publications` tab on your [dashboard](./dashboard.md).
There, you find a list of all available public datasets.
Click on the dataset name to open the dataset.

Once you are in the view mode, you are presented with three orthongonal views and one 3D viewport.
You can use the following shortcuts to navigate the data.
See the full list of [gestures and keyboard shortcuts](./keyboard_shortcuts.md) for advanced use.

| Shortcut                      | Operation                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Left Mouse Drag or Arrow Keys | Move In-Plane                   |
| SPACE or Mousewheel           | Move Forward                    |
| SHIFT + SPACE or Mousewheel   | Move Backward                   |
| I or ALT + Mousewheel         | Zoom In                         |
| O or ALT + Mousewheel         | Zoom Out                        |
| Scroll Mousewheel (3D View)   | Zoom In And Out                 |
| Right Click Drag (3D View)    | Rotate 3D View                  |
| . (Dot)                       | Toggle Viewport Maximization    |

You can also change the size of the viewports to see more details in your data and customize your layout.

## Your First Annotation
Click the `Create Annotation` button from the view mode of a dataset to create your first annotation.
webKnossos will launch the main annotation screen allowing you to navigate your dataset and place markers to reconstruct skeletons.

Drag the mouse while pressing the left mouse button to navigate the dataset.
Right-click in the data to place markers, called nodes.
Basic movement in the dataset is done with the mouse wheel or by pressing the spacebar keyboard shortcut.

Learn more about the skeleton, volume, and hybrid annotations as well as the interface in the [Annotation UI guide](./tracing_ui.md).
