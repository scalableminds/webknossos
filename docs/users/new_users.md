# Sign Up & Invitations for New User Accounts

On webknossos.org, users can either sign up for a WEBKNOSSOS account by themselves or be invited through email to join an existing organization by co-workers or collaborators.

    As an admin or team manager, you can invite users to join your WEBKNOSSOS organization by clicking the `Invite Users` button at the top of the `Users` list available from the `Admin` menu in the navbar. This will open a popup where you can enter a list of email addresses, which will receive a custom invitation link. Users that click on this link are automatically assigned to your organization, and will not need manual activation.
