## Controls & Keyboard Shortcuts for Skeleton Annotations

While most operations for working with skeleton annotations are either available through the UI or the context-sensitive right-click menu, some users prefer to use keyboard shortcuts to work very efficiently.

| Key Binding | Operation                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Left Click  | Create New Node                                    |
| Left Click  | Select Node (Mark as Active Node) under the cursor |
| Left Drag   | Move around                                        |
| Left Drag   | Move the node under the cursor                     |
| S           | Center Camera on Active Node                       |
| DEL         | Delete Active Node                                 |
| B           | Create Branch Point                                |
| J           | Jump to Last Branch Point                          |
| C           | Create New Tree                                    |

Note that you can enable _Classic Controls_ which will behave slightly different and more explicit for some mouse actions:

| Key Binding        | Operation                                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Left Drag          | Move around                                                            |
| Right Click        | Create New Node                                                        |
| SHIFT + Left Click | Select Node (Mark as Active Node)                                      |
| Left Drag          | Move the node under the cursor (unless _Classic Controls_ are enabled) |
