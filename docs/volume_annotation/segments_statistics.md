# Segment Statistics
WEBKNOSSOS provides handy statistics about your labelled segments, such as the volume and bounding box of a segment.

There is several ways to access this information: 
1. Right-click any segment to bring up the context menu. The segment statistics are listed at the end of the context menu.
2. In the `Segments` tab in the right-hand panel, right-click on any group of segments (or the "Root" group) to bring up a context menu. Select `Show Segment Statistics` to access a summary table with statistics for a whole group of labelled segments. These can be exported as CSV files for further analysis outside of WEBKNOSSOS.

In cases, where you only wish to measure a simple distance or surface area, use the [`Measurement Tool`](../ui/toolbar.md) instead.
