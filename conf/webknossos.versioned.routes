# API versioning is handled here. Higher-Priority routes first

# example: assume, the features route has changed, introducing v2. The older v1 needs to be provided in the legacyApiController
#->      /v2/      webknossos.Routes


# GET    /v1/features                                                         controllers.LegacyApiController.v1features
->       /v1/      webknossos.latest.Routes


->       /         webknossos.latest.Routes
