<p>Hi @{name},</p>

<p>
  oops, unfortunately WEBKNOSSOS could not upload and convert your dataset <i>@{datasetName}</i> automatically. 
  This should not have happend and we are sorry about the inconvenience. Our engineers will investigate and fix the
  problem as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>Here are some tips for uploading and converting datasets:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.webknossos.org/webknossos/data_formats.html">See the document on supported files formats</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.webknossos.org/webknossos-py/index.html">Try our Python library for uploading datasets</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.webknossos.org/webknossos/datasets.html#working-with-zarr-neuroglancer-precomputed-and-n5-datasets">Try streaming your data as Zarr, Neuroglancer, or N5 files instead of uploading</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
