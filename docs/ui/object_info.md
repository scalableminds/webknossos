# Object Info and Lists

## Right-Hand Side Panel
The right-hand side panel includes a number of tabs with specific information, additional interactions, listings about your current skeleton and/or volume annotation. When working with any of the WEBKNOSSOS annotation tools (see above), any interactions with the dataset will lead to entries in the listing provided here.

- `Info`: Contains mostly metainformation about the dataset and annotation. Can be used to name an annotation and provide an additional description, e.g., when sharing with collaborators. 
- `Skeleton`: Lists all available skeleton annotations and offers further interactions with them. [Read more about skeleton annotations.](./skeleton_annotation.md)
- `Comments`: Lists all comments assigned to individual nodes of a skeleton. [Read more about comments and skeleton annotations.](./skeleton_annotation.md#nodes_and_trees)
- `Segments`: List all segments created during a volume annotation. It also provides access to mesh generation for individual segments or the whole dataset, mesh visualization, mesh downloads, and more. [Read more about 3D meshes.](./mesh_visualization.md)
- `BBoxes`: List all bounding boxes present in the dataset. Create new bounding boxes or adjust existing ones. This provides an alternative interface for the `Bounding Box` tool.
- `AbsTree`: Renders and abstract 2D tree representation of a skeleton annotation when enabled. Might be quite resource intense when working with large skeletons.
