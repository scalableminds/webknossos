      <p>
        This annotation does not have volume annotation data in all resolutions. Consequently,
        annotation data cannot be rendered at all zoom values. By clicking &quot;Downsample&quot;,
        WEBKNOSSOS will use the best resolution of the volume data to create all dependent
        resolutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following resolutions will be added when clicking &quot;Downsample&quot;:{" "}
        {magsToDownsample.map((mag) => mag.join("-")).join(", ")}.
      </p>
      <div>
        The cause for the missing resolutions can be one of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The annotation was created before WEBKNOSSOS supported multi-resolution volume tracings.
          </li>
          <li>An old annotation was uploaded which did not include all resolutions.</li>
          <li>The annotation was created in a task that was restricted to certain resolutions.</li>
          <li>The dataset was mutated to have more resolutions.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p
        style={{
          fontWeight: "bold",
        }}
      >
        Note that this action might take a few minutes. Afterwards, the annotation is reloaded.
        Also, the version history of the volume data will be reset.
      </p>
