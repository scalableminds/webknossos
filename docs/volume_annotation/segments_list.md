# Segments List

The right-hand side panel offers a `Segments` tab that lists segments and allows to edit these.
A segment is added to the list as soon as it was clicked in the data viewport.
The following functionality is available for each segment:

- jumping to the segment (via left-click; this uses the position at which the segment was initially registered)
- naming the segment
- toggling the visibility of the segment (the visibility of unlisted segments is controlled with the `Hide unlisted segments` setting in the left sidebar in the `Layers` tab)
- [loading 3D meshes](../meshes/loading_meshes.md) for the segments (ad-hoc and precomputed if available)
- download of 3D meshes
- changing the color of the segment, and if its mesh is visible, changing the mesh's opacity using the opacity slider of the segment color picker
- activating the segment id (so that you can annotate with that id)
- organizing your segments in groups

Working with groups allows you to perform batch actions of a whole group of segment (e.g. changing the color, loading meshes, ...)
