## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/21.11.0...HEAD)

### Added
- Added tagging support for datasets. [#5832](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5832)
- Dataset upload back-end now supports linking layers of existing public datasets. [#5863](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5863)

### Changed

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where dataset uploads that contained files larger than 2 GB failed. [#5889](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5889)
- Fixed that dataset uploads did not survive back-end restarts. [#5831](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5831)
- Fixed a bug where NMLs with unconnected trees and nested tree groups could not be uploaded due to wrong tree group IDs. [#5893](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5893)
- Fixed a security vulnerability by upgrading log4j to newest version. [#5900](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5900)

### Removed
-

### Breaking Change
- When using the front-end API, functions that accept a layer name, such as `api.data.getDataValue`, won't interpret the name "segmentation" as the current volume tracing if it exists. Instead, "segmentation" can only be used if the current dataset has a layer which is named "segmentation". If you want to interact with the volume tracing layer, use `api.data.getVolumeTracingLayerIds()` instead. Also see `api.data.getSegmentationLayerNames` and `api.data.getVisibleSegmentationLayer`. [#5771](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5771)
- The datastore server routes `/datasets/reserveUpload` and `/datasets/finishUpload` now expect the additional field `layersToLink`, which should be an empty list by default. [#5863](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5863
