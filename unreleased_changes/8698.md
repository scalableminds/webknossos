### Changed
- Changed the process for adding changelog and migration guide items to avoid merge conflicts. Instead of editing the "*.unreleased.md" files, developers should run `python3 tools/create-changelog-entry.py`. This will create a md file within `unreleased_changes` with the number of the current pull request. The file will contain the correct format with dummy values for the changelog and migration guide. The developer should adapt the template and commit it. When bundlign a release, these changelog files will be read and written into the released changelog/migration guide.
