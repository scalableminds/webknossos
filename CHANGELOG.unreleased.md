- Fix that "Compute Mesh File" button was enabled in scenarios where it should not be supported (e.g., when no segmentation layer exists). [#5648](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5648)

### Breaking Change
- The interface of the cross-origin API changed. The initialization message is no longer an object with a `message` property of "api ready", but instead an object with a `type` property of "init". Additionally, if an API call finishes, a return message of type "ack" is sent. If the original API call contained a `messageId` property, the return message will contain the same `messageId` to allow to match the return message. If the API call is misformatted, a return message of `type` "err" is sent, containing an error message in the `message` property.
