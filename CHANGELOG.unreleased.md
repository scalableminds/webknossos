## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/24.06.0...HEAD)

### Added
- Added the option for the owner to lock explorative annotations. Locked annotations cannot be modified by any user. An annotation can be locked in the annotations table and when viewing the annotation via the navbar dropdown menu. [#7801](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7801)
- Uploading an annotation into a dataset that it was not created for now also works if the dataset is in a different organization. [#7816](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7816)
- When downloading + reuploading an annotation that is based on a segmentation layer with active mapping, that mapping is now still be selected after the reupload. [#7822](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7822)

### Changed
- The "WEBKNOSSOS Changelog" modal now lazily loads its content potentially speeding up the initial loading time of WEBKNOSSOS and thus improving the UX. [#7843](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7843)
- From now on only project owner get a notification email upon project overtime. The organization specific email list `overTimeMailingList` was removed. [#7842](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7842)
- Replaced skeleton comment tab component with antd's `<Tree />`component. [#7802](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7802)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where brushing on a fallback segmentation with active mapping and with segment index file would lead to failed saves. [#7833](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/7833)
