### Changed
- When zooming out too far in proofreading annotations, the segmentation will be hidden and the user will be warned now. In the past, the rendering of segmentations was very slow when zoomed out too far which is why this is avoided now altogether. The reason for this is that the amount of segmentation IDs that need to be mapped grows with the zoom level.
