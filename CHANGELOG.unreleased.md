## Unreleased
[Commits](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/compare/21.02.0...HEAD)

### Added
- Added an explicit `/signup` (or `/auth/signup`) route. [#5091](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5091/files)

### Changed
- Support for the old invite links was removed. These contained the organization name in the URL. The new links contain a token (can be generated in the users view). For instances with a single organization the old invite links should still work. [#5091](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5091/files)
- Users are no longer allowed to deactivate their own accounts.  [#5070](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos/pull/5070)
