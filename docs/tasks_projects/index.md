# Managing Tasks and Projects

WEBKNOSSOS includes a powerful task and project management system to efficiently annotate large datasets. Large annotations can be broken down into smaller workpieces and distributed to members of your organization. ("Divide and conquer approach")

The task systems is designed for automated task distribution to a (large) group of annotators based on several criteria, e.g., experience, access rights, etc. For fine-grained control, manual task assignments are also possible.
